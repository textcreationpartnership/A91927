         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Although the crooked nature of man think's it but her miſerie to think how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie ſhee hath been, yet the Lord purpoſeth by this means to bring her back to her firſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, if ſhee will bee ruled by him.</p>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170649:5"/>
which by his mercifull providence hee hath left in common nature.</p>
                  <p>This ſtir's us up to two meditations. <hi>First,</hi> if ſin (as defaceing a blemiſh as it is) yet could not ſo quite root out that honor and majeſtie of God in man, but ſtill hee hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved (for univerſal ends) ſom reliques there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (for elſ whence is it that the Lord hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied thoſe uſefull creatures, the horſ and the ox and others, to feel their own ſtrength, and the curſ of man, ſo that they ſhould quite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his ſervice: do they not ſtill fear the ſhadow of God's image? and are they not aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full? nay, do they not yeeld themſelvs to his tameing and ſubduing power?) what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delible character is there in his ſecond image of righteouſneſs enſtamped by the Spirit of Chriſt? who dare ſay that any thing can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face that laſting image?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly</hi> what reverend reſpect ſhould wee yeeld to the ruined image of God in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? who ſhould dare to mock and diſdain thoſe whom God hath doubly impaired his image in? even the lame, the blinde, the deaf, the imporent and crooked.</p>

To provoke us (if wee are not quite forlorn) both to mourn, that for ſo baſe objects and luſts ſake wee have deſpiſed ſo great graces as have been offered us: and alſo to excite our appetites to long after it, and to groan under our inabilitie to beleev it; ſaying, O Lord I was born to excellencie and honor, and ſhall not thy perſwaſions draw my heart to recover my loſt eſtate? and ſhould not each day ſeem ten to us (when wee may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain it) till the Lord hath ſetled it again in Chriſt upon us?</p>

                  <p>Both in reſpect of ſin, and puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>1. HIs actual ſin brought forth Original: his Original all Actual ſins: and both theſe procured all penalties. So that by the wrath of God was inflicted upon him the loſs of God's image ſtanding in righteouſneſs and true holineſs; a deprival of the glorie of God both in Soul and bodie. Hence came that ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter impotencie of minde and members, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to will, or execute any good.

                  <list>
                     <item>1. Original guilt.</item>
                     <item>2. Original ſtain or pollution: both being the fountains of all actual guilt and pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of conſcience.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Original guilt is that privitie and refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of conſcience, whereby hee told himſelf continnally that hee had fallen, and therefore muſt die the death in each kinde of it, bodie and Soul. This perpetual Alarum of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in his nature was the firſt part of his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170649:10"/>
miſerie. And to ſay the truth, what miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is like to this? to bee ever on the rack of a man's own ſpirit, ſuggeſting and boading him ſad things to com for his ſin, threatning him with perpetual ruine.</p>
                  <p>Original ſtain, or pollution is ſet forth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the whole, or in the parts. Touching the whole, the holy Ghoſt expreſſeth it by the word <hi>Death:</hi> for as death is the reſolution of nature; ſo is this death of the Soul a total a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhment and corruption of that bleſſed frame of creätion, in Minde by light, in Will by holineſs. Touching the parts, in the <hi>minde</hi> there is a death of all pure light and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg: in the <hi>will,</hi> of ſubjection: in the <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> of direction to the right objects: in the <hi>conſcience,</hi> of all welfare and pureneſs: in the <hi>ſpirits, ſenſes and members,</hi> there is a death of that abilitie and ſerviceableneſs to the Soul in good things; and a proneneſs and tickling to bee imploied profanely and unholily. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, there is a death of the <hi>Perſon,</hi> in reſpect of that right and ſovereigntie over the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, with a ſlaviſh proneneſs rather to ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize them, both in the worſhip of ſom, and the love or uſe of others; a declenfion from God, and a revolt to the baſe creature, as <hi>Eve</hi> did to the forbidden fruit.</p>
                  <p>The miſerie of <hi>Actual ſin</hi> is the depraved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of death of all the operations flowing from
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170649:10"/>
the ſoul within, or the bodie without.</p>
                  <p>11. The <hi>miſerie of puniſhment</hi> ſtand's in the manifold penalties both of ſoul and bodie. In <hi>the Soul first,</hi> an averſneſs from God, an unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pableneſs of admitting of any meanes to draw the Soul out of miſerie to any better eſtate, a ſpirit of reſiſting and oppoſition to any ſuch: a proneneſs to bee riveted more and more deeply into this wo, with leſs or leſs feeling or believing it. <hi>Touching the bodie,</hi> what languors and diſeaſes are incident to it: what povertie, baſeneſs, beggerie and want to the eſtate? what reproach to the name and credit? aſperſions, ſlanders, diſhonors? what miſerie in familie, Church and Common-wealth? Croſſes, ſtreights, purſuits, loſſes, forfeits, death of friends, impriſonment, bad tideings, famin war, peſtilence and a thouſand waies for him to go wofullie out, who came but one way into the World: beſides grief of minde, melancholie paſſions and diſtempers of the ſpirit, bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ill marriage, lewd children, ill ſucceſs, ruine of eſtate, and at laſt a miſerable death: and yet the upſhot of all is worſt after, <hi>viz.</hi> a final ſeparation from GOD, and loſs of his eternal preſence, with the ſenſ of unutterable, intolerable, unavoidable wrath of God in Hell upon the whole man for ever, without the leaſt hope of help or redreſs in or from himſelf.</p>

As God would have imputed <hi>Adam's</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie to us, if hee had ſtood therein, ſo might hee impute his ſin.</p>

                  <p>THe Apoſtle 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. divide's the work of the Law into two ſorts: 1. One upon the righteous as an eternal pattern and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of righteouſneſs. 2. As it is a meanes to convince the ungodly, and to reveal to them their ſinfull and curſed condition. The Law work's two things in particular: 1. <hi>Know. ledg.</hi> 2, <hi>Conviction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Law firſt ſearche's the Soul, it's the Candle of the LORD, and pierce's the bowels of the Spirit, thoſe ſecret windeings and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſhifts and evaſions of it, bee they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo colorable and ſubtil. The Lord hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it authoritie over the Conſcience as his own Bailief, to hunt out and diſcern ſin in the colors, in the kindes of it, open, ſecret, thoughts, affections, yea concupiſcence: not the bare letter of the Law but the Spirit. And the conſcience of the unregenerate being once thus ſtirred, is as the light of the Law to bring God into each privie part. That moſt holie and wiſe God who firſt contrived the Law,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170649:14"/>
put the light of his own pure majeſtie into it, and enabled it to diſcover ſin to the Soul, not as other lawes to ſpeak to the ear, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. And as light, ſo conviction alſo, both are put into the law by the ſame God, whoſe fingers wrote it.</p>
                  <p>The Law diſcover's not the unbelief of the Goſpel: for it is a model of the righteouſneſs of creätion, in which there is no need of faith: therefore it onely reveale's thoſe ſins which make us guiltie without a remedie, thatt might drive us to ſeek a remedie.</p>
                  <p>The Law diſcover's all ſort of ſin, Actual and Original, and the curſ that lie's upon us: And this it doth 1. by diſperſing thoſe miſts of ignorance, that ſuffer not the light to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. 2. By removing the bars againſt it: which are chiefly theſe:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Prejudice againſt the light, the meanes of light and inſtruments of light, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's them from Knowledg.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Cuſtom in darkneſs: they have lived as their fore-fathers, and don well enough.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hardneſs of heart and purpoſe to to live in their luſts ſtill.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Woful bluntneſs of edg and bluntneſs of Spirit, by which they make themſelvs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of Knowledg.</p>

ſins, which everie one may read in great letters running; and through eaſ ſeek no further: becauſ indeed knowledg in not their aim, but their policie to avoid the ſhame of groſs igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Self-love, by which hee is loath to bee informed in truths: his partialitie and ſubtiltie, which ſuffer's him not to bear ſuch truths, as are like to oppoſe his perſonal, pretious and beloved evils, whereby hee is loath to hear of any ſins, ſave other mens, not his own.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Errors of our own conceit of ſound righteouſneſs, to wit, that wee have ſerved God well, both in ſhunning of ſin, or doing dutie, when wee have been drawn to it onely by forrein compulſion, or outward occaſions.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>1. In <hi>themſelvs,</hi> ſundry waies.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By her <hi>authoritie</hi> in commanding, ſetting up herſelf in the conſcience the moſt privie chamber of the Soul: this no law of man can do.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By her <hi>harmonie,</hi> conſent and coherence: this no man can ſee except enlightned. <hi>Jam. 2. 10. bee that break's one, is culpable of all.</hi> As hee that break's one Link of a golden chain, breake's the coherence. As hee that break's his neighbors fence treſpaſſe's him as well as if
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170649:15"/>
hee ranged over all his ground, becauſe the bond is broken.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By her <hi>royaltie:</hi> That as a King is not preſcribed againſt by the qualitie of any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject offending, why hee may not hold him guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: So in this no perſon is accepted of God in this kinde. This royal law is impartial, it will ſhew a Queen her ſports as well as a poor woman.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By her <hi>integritie</hi> and <hi>ſoundneſs:</hi> that is, it open's ſin to the ſoul in one kinde as well as the other. Such is the corruption of <hi>Adam</hi> that it will ſuffer much of the bodie of ſin to vaniſh in the ſurvey. But where God enlighten's hee diſcover's ſin in all her ſexes, male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, ſtrong and weak, remembred and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, ignorance and knowledg, in a word, one and other: for want of which many a Soul never com's to the bar of God's conviction.</p>
                  <p>This rule ſhew's the difference of theſe:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>ſins of Omiſſion</hi> are paſſings by, and balking of ſom dutie behooving to bee don whether againſt, or without knowledg.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>ſins of Commiſſion</hi> are actual do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of ſom evill (in thought, word and deed) againſt the revealed will of God, whether wee bee convinced or not convinced convinced thereof, to bee ſin: as to work upon the Sabbath, to ſpeak vainly, to nouriſh baſe thoughes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>ſins of Knowledg</hi> are tranſgreſſions
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170649:16"/>
of the Law of God againſt a mans conſcience, and the check of it, whether greater or ſmaller: as when <hi>Shimei</hi> paiſed <hi>Jordan</hi> againſt his own covenant, or, when a man goeth againſt his own light. <hi>Sins of Ignorance</hi> are, when a man tranſgreſſeth, but yet not knowing his ſin to bee ſin, as <hi>Abimelech</hi> coveting of <hi>Sarah, Paul</hi>'s perſecuteing the Church.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Sins of weakneſs</hi> or <hi>Preſumption</hi> differ one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from ſins of knowledg in the intention of him that ſinneth: Not each ſin of knowledg amounteth to a ſin of preſumption, though all preſumption muſt need's bee a ſin againſt knowledg. <hi>Sin of preſumption</hi> then is a ſin of knowledg committed with an high hand. <hi>Sin of weakneſs</hi> is a ſinning againſt ſuch knowledg as yet is prevented in her work through acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: as either inabilitie of grace to ſtick to knowledg, or, through timerouſneſs and fear, although dalliance and wantonneſs bee abſent, and though conſcience bee preſent to accuſe. 5ly. Sins of preſumption it ſelf are not all one: for ſom are onely preſumptuous in act, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s adulterie and murther: others are total, when a man is totally and finally carried in a preſumptuous ſtream of habited ſinning. This trencheth moſt horribly againſt the patience and long-ſuffering of Grace it ſelf: and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly drawe's impenitencie of ſpirit upon it ſelf, which cannot repent when it would.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170649:16"/>
6ly. A juſt fruit of this dalliance with grace habitually, is that total and final Deſertion of God's ſpirit, giveing over the preſumptuous heart to ſuch a ſinning againſt grace, as at laſt deſpiteth that grace, which it hath ſo long ſlighted; as the Gnat which burneth it ſelf in the candle: and this is called ſinning againſt the holy Ghoſt differing from habited Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in this, That in that a man ſinneth againſt the grace of the Spirit: but in this, a man deſpiteth the Spirit of Grace it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>5. By her <hi>extent:</hi> it is a great piece of the light of the law to extend it ſelf in the ſoul to all parts and degrees of ſin: 1. in her <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualneſs,</hi> teaching us not to reſt onely in open, groſs, moral offences, but to go to ſpiritual wickedneſs. 2. In her <hi>inquiſition</hi> and <hi>ſearch:</hi> it dare and can go to any part of the whole man, and fetch out any poyſon out of any corner. 3. in her <hi>aggravateing power:</hi> whereby ſhee inlarge's ſin by her circumſtances, cauſing it thereby to ſeem the more odious, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the worſ colors upon it; as becauſ ſuch a perſon committed it, a publick man, againſt ſuch light, when hee needed not, from meer malignitie of Spirit, in the mid'ſt of bleſſings, againſt mercie, goſpel, vowes, covenant, &amp;c. 4, <hi>in her puritie:</hi> the law doth not go tell the Soul of each ſin; but ſet's the mirror of God's
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170649:17"/>
pureneſs before her, that ſhee may according thereto diſcern and judg of ſin; good and bad, true and evil.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are helps to ſerv the work of the law in convinceing, not to foreſtall the work of the Spirit. ſhe more ſound light the ſoul hath, the better: Howbeit, God is free to work in what way and meaſure h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e pleaſ.</p>
                  <p>II. The law diſcover's ſin by the <hi>Penalties.</hi> The Lord take's away all diſtinction of venial and mortal ſin from a man: preſent's himſelf to him in his full juſtice of revenging all ſin without exception: tell's the Soul, deferring of puniſhment is no remoovall of it, that all ſins deſerv all puniſhments; that the leaſt coſt the Lord Jeſus his blood, and hee that beleev's it not, ſhall pay for it in hell: there is no ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hid from God's eye; no ſhift, or evaſion beſides faith and repentance.</p>
                  <p>The Lord diſcover's Original ſin to the ſoul many waies:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>By the ſpecial terms of his Word:</hi> the Lord is in no one thing ſo emphatical, as in the names hee give's to this poyſon. Hee call's it <hi>the old man, the fleſh, luſt, concupiſcence, the law of the members, the law of ſin reigning in the members, the bodie of death</hi> and the like.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>By compariſon.</hi> For when the Soul hath had the view of actual ſins before, as moſt irkſom, and now com's to ſee greater abominations
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170649:17"/>
then theſe, as the Lord tell's <hi>Ezek.</hi> Chap. 8. 15. Oh! how out of meature ſinful ſeem's it to the ſoul? how doth ſhee crie out, miſerable man! for mark, thus ſhee ſpeak's, although actual ſins were enough to ſink mee into miſerie, yet I ſee they were but evil in reſpect of their part: but now I ſee a bodie of all parts and members, a King in his throne. I ſee now my ſelf curſed double and trebble.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>By the properties of Original ſin.</hi> as,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is <hi>eminently ſinfull:</hi> it's more ſin then other ſins: Whatſoever is in any of them, is here more notoriouſly: whatſover filth and baſe qualitie may bee ſpied in all, or any ſin, is here more ſingularly: as light and heat is in our fire, or the air, or the Moon, but eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Sun, the firſt ſubject and ſeat of it. All the poyſon of actual evils is ſeated in the Original, after whoſe copie they write: and therefore Original is greateſt, as the ſeed, which in her power contain's thirtie-ſold.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Predominantly,</hi> both in reſpect of fulneſs and force. For <hi>fulneſs,</hi> it hath all ſin under it, and in it, as the perfect bodie hath all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: 'tis the fewell of the fire of ſinful acts. For <hi>force, Paul</hi> call's a Law. Princes rule ſtrongly by their lawes, they are as a ſoul wholly and en each part: nothing ſo forcible, there is a neceſſitie in a law: it break's down and carrie's all before it.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:170649:18"/>3. <hi>Perpetually.</hi> Wee ſay the King hath a perpetual patrimonie that is not alienable: ſo hath a Sinner by his original ſin: Hee may fail in his ſpending-money, as in his policie and ſtrength, and induſtrie to oppreſs, to defile his bodie: but his ſtock and patrimonie never fail's. If it bee ſo in the beſt of God's ſervants (<hi>Luther</hi> himſelf little moleſted with covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet hee had this Stock ſtill within) how much more is it true of each ſinner.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is an <hi>Over-flowing ſin</hi> and natural. Fire and water are ill maſters, but they burn and over-flow naturally. It pleaſe's us becauſ it is natural, and hath a ſelf-perſwaſion which carrie's it ſmoothly, unſuſpiciouſly, and by priveledg. It is my nature to ſmite when I am angry: it's my nature to bee ſoon hot: it's therefore the more dangerous and curſed.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>The bondage of it.</hi> It binde's up the Soul in death, hardneſs, inſenſibleneſs, incapable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of any good, averſneſs to all meanes of grace.</p>

                  <p>Thus much of the firſt work of the law, <hi>i e.</hi> knowledg of ſin as ſin.</p>
                  <p>II. The ſecond work of the Law is <hi>Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi> and this is twofold: I. Simple convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>viz.</hi> of the judgment. 2. Conviction with terror, <hi>viz.</hi> of the whole Soul, or whole man.</p>
                  <p>When once the ſoul is thorowly enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, if the law proceed in her work, ſhee com's to apply her light to this convincing of the ſoul: and <hi>firſt</hi> by cauſing the conſcience to join againſt itſelf, and to ſay, <hi>thou art the man. Again,</hi> by a due yeelding of the ſoul to lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170649:19"/>
the bondage and fear of puniſhment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to ſuch a ſinners wofull eſtate.</p>
                  <p>1. This work of the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> Conviction of the judgment, is the ſecond work of the Miniſterie of the Law, by the efficacie whereof, the ſoul beleev's herſelf to bee that which ſhee knowe's, to wit, this ſinful and curſed one. A moſt powerful work: yet no other then the poor Miniſter of God enabled by the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Law, may and doth perform. The Law effect's this <hi>conviction</hi> by removeing three letts: 1. Deadneſs of ſpirit. 2. Sloth and eaſ. 3. Subtiltie and hollowneſs. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily put's a quickuing, and a diligent and plain conſent to the light, into the ſoul.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Deadneſs of Spirit.</hi> Love of luſts and cuſtom therein with delight, doth defile and beſot the powers of the minde, that as one buſie in his game doth not liſten to a ſad tale: ſo neither doth this minde to the end of the law in enlightning.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Looſ incogitancie</hi> and <hi>careleſneſs,</hi> by which men run up and down with light, as the dog with his chain broken looſ. So doth a ſloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heart, even cut's its own throat.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The worſt of the three, <hi>Subtiltie</hi> and <hi>ſly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> when men pretend they have received the light to believ it: but they lie, and their falſ
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170649:20"/>
hearts are defiled with ſom ſecret root of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs, which will not ſuffer them to bee plain.</p>
                  <p>Now the Mniſterie of the Law grapple's with theſe, by jogging the ſoul, and not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring her to bee any of theſe, but beeing more forcible in ſetting the Word home to the ſoul, and breaking open that lock which will not ſhoot of it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>And this it doth many waies:</p>
                  <p>1. By entring into a ſolemn judicious courſ with the ſoul, and by applying the light to her by particular evidence-giveing in againſt her, that ſhee is this childe of death. When the Lord meane's to go thorowly to work, hee will ſuffer no luſt, no ſloth nor falſhood to keep off the ſoul from her light, but (will ſhee, nill ſhee) ſhee ſhall not onely almoſt, but alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether bee convinced. Now to bring the light and the ſoul cloſe together is the great wiſdom of the Spirit in the Miniſterie of the Law. <hi>Somtimes</hi> hee firſt inſinuate's into the heart by ſlight or cunning, and trap's the ſoul ere it bee aware in his net. Thus <hi>Nathan</hi> came upon <hi>David. Somtimes</hi> hee take's the ſoul napping in the mid'ſt and her ſin, while the ſent is freſh: thus hee deal't with <hi>Saul. Somtimes,</hi> by conteſting with conſcience, and urging
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170649:20"/>
her to ſpeak truth upon experience.</p>
                  <p>2. By violence and neceſſitie, when no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſ will ſerv. This the Lord doth by threats apart, and ſomtimes by the addition of ſom works convince. Thus God deal't with <hi>Saul,</hi> and with <hi>Achan.</hi> Somtimes the Lord is fain to circumvent a Sinner in his own courſ, and to bring forth the long-concealed marks of his ſin to his face, bidding him denie it if hee dare. Thus <hi>Tamar</hi> deal't with <hi>Juda. Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times</hi> by croſſes, ſo was <hi>Manaſſes</hi> taken in the buſhes. So the <hi>Prodigal.</hi> Somtimes by patience and long-ſuffering, and thus <hi>Saul</hi> (in a pang) was convinced of <hi>David</hi>'s innocencie.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> I. Of ſad mourning for the daies wee are in, in which this ſpirit of the Law ſeem's to bee loſt: even as the Ark and Ephod were in the daies of the ſecond Temple. Oh! it is heavie to ponder, how few conſciences are rouzed up and gaſtred from their dregs under Miniſteries of 7, 10, 20 yeers continuance! but ſtill the ſame men and change no color.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> II. Of Admonition both to Miniſters and people. <hi>Firſt</hi> to <hi>Miniſters,</hi> that they pray and ſtrive for the Spirit of conviction, It's God's gift: and one chief part is to bee Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Spirit, not of the Letter. The manner of of our diſpenſation is more then
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170649:21"/>
our voice, and as much as our matter. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> to <hi>people:</hi> They muſt bee warned to ſhake off their lets of conviction: <hi>Let the righteouus ſmite you, it ſhall bee as a balm.</hi> Thus <hi>Abigail</hi> was welcom to <hi>David.</hi> Self-love is an Adder, which will not hear the voice of the Charmer. The ſweetneſs of uſurie, pleaſure, lawful liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,, eaſ will bee as a <hi>Delilah</hi> to keep off the leaſt conviction of the law.</p>
                  <p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> III. Examin thy ſelf about this weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie work of the law, that thou maieſt hope to go on more ſafely. Try it by theſe markes: 1. By the love of a convinceing Miniſterie, and loathing of the contrarie. 2. A cleering of God, and the righteouſneſs of his law: call thy ſelf the Slave ſold under ſin. As hee to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan,</hi> give glorie to God. Hugg the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon that lanceth thee. 3. Shame and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for ſin. The Publican durſt not look up. 4. By thy thanks to God for this merciful work. 5. Bee thou under this confuſion till God raiſ thee up. Let rottenneſs enter into thy bones, that peace may bee in the day of trouble. Cruſt not over thy ſore. Wax not wearie of this work of God, as moſt do. 6. Let it end in the true conſternation of Soul and terror for thy ſin.</p>
                  <p>Thus far of <hi>conviction of judgment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:170649:21"/>II. The ſecond work of <hi>conviction, is of the whole Soul,</hi> called Terror and Bondage. For when the former work of conviction hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, it work's thus, that ſuch a Soul is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an arreſt, and ſeeing it ſelf this ſinner, this curſed one: hee is thereby killed: and the Spirit brought into terror and bondage. <hi>Rom. 7. Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>When the Law came I died.</hi> Meaning in ſpirit and in conſcience. That ſelf of jollitie, eaſ and ſecuritie which ſin affoard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was nip't and quaſh't: and in ſtead of it a ſad <hi>item</hi> given to the ſoul, takeing away the taſte of her morſels, mixing the gall of Aſps with her drink, and ſtinging her as an Adder, and ſtabbing her to the heart as a ſword for her convinced villanies: Yea and none more then this bodie of death, which ſtill dogg's her, and wound's her as faſt as ſhee lick's herſelf whole with all duties or abſtinences, and works and ſhifts, prooving her a ſlave ſold under miſerie, and ſhewing her by nature a world of ſin and wo to bear down all her moralitie &amp; hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. And yet this terror is not grace, but in the Elect a ſeed of it: This work in Scripture is called the <hi>Spirit of fear,</hi> or <hi>bondage:</hi> not bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to ſin, but by it: whereby, as they who are priſoners under chaines do lie in ſorrow and horror without eſcape and hope, ſo do
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170649:22"/>
theſe. Their ſpirit is enſlaved to fear, their conſcience to guilt, accuſation, to the whip of wrath and juſtice, yea cruſh't down to hell by the torment of ſuch a ſpirit as cannot ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain it ſelf for the reſtleſs anguiſh thereof, but abide's and hang's between earth and hell.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Legal terror</hi> is explained by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of three things eſpecially.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The difference.</item>
                     <item>2. The nature, effects and end of it.</item>
                     <item>3. The extremities or abuſe of it.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>I. By <hi>differencing of it from the former conviction.</hi> The work of <hi>enlightning</hi> caſt's out ignorance: the work of <hi>convincing</hi> reſiſt's deadneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibleneſs. But this third of conſternation and terror reſiſt's that pride and jollitie of a ſinner, over-bearing himſelf and lifting up himſelf in his ſin without check or remorſ. And this later is of all other, the moſt proper work of the laſt, to tame and beat down the loftie heart of man, ſetting up a law to it ſelf to walk as it liſteth without law or fear. It is as <hi>Leviathan</hi> pulling down all children of pride.</p>
                  <p>II. By <hi>the nature, effects and end of it.</hi> Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>nature</hi> of it, It is a preſenting (more or leſs) of the wrath and penalties due to ſin, unto the whole man, by the conſcience, for the caſting of it down at the feet of God. Firſt,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170649:22"/>
it's a <hi>preſenting:</hi> for the dead bare letter of the ten Commandements cannot do this by any magical power: no, it's the powerful mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the Law which can do it. Although in appearance it bee weak, yet God ſetting it on work with the authoritie of his ſpirit, with power to carrie his errand into the ſoul, it ſhal bee able without fear or flatterie to do it, and to do that which no law of Princes can effect, even to flait and gaſter the Conſcience Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it doth preſent the <hi>wrath and penalties of ſin eſpecially.</hi> Till theſe com, ſin is at peace. This wrath, I ſay, in the peanalties of it, temporal, ſpiritual, and eternal, the law preſent's to a ſinful ſoul. Thirdly, <hi>unto the whole man, by the conſcience:</hi> for as the law is the worker, ſo the conſcience is the immediate object of this wrath. God hath made it the lawes object: created it with a merveilous power of ſenſible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (above all parts) to record and to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all ſin and wrath for it. It exceed's the apprehenſion of any the tendreſt part, when it is ſtung with an Adder, ſcalded with water or oyl, burnt with fire, cut with a ſword: The ſenſ of conſcience ſeazed with this wrath of God is unſpeakable and cannot bee uttered by man. In this it is differenced, firſt from the <hi>ignorant, erroneous,</hi> and <hi>ſuperſtitious conſcience</hi> not
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170649:23"/>
fearing at all, or fearing amiſs. Secondly, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed conſcience,</hi> dallying with God, half con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, and half whole. Thirdly, ſeared and hardned conſcience, which by long rebellion and reſiſtance of the law hath got the maſterie of the law, and is waxen ſenſleſs and uſeleſs, forgetting her offices.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The act of the law in all this, is, <hi>to caſt down the ſoul at the feet of God.</hi> For there is in nature an intolerable bearing up a mans ſelf in his eſtate, a prideing of himſelf, boldneſs, boaſting of ſin. Hee is ſo far from beeing aſhamed, that, till the law com home to him thus, <hi>bee is alive,</hi> Rom. 7. 9. that is, jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, jocand, merrie, as the fool that caſt's ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, darts, and ſaith, <hi>Am I not in ſport?</hi> A Sinner's crown is not his bare ſin in corners and by ſtealth: that is his wo, his law: but his crown is his libertie of ſpirit in it, to do what hee liſt, to run, ride, talk, practice, to drink, ſwear, lie, and couzen, and no man controll him. Now this jollitie and boldneſs and pride in ſin, the Lord in his miniſterie of the law reſiſt's; and that hee doth when hee pull's the ſinner upon his knees, caſt's his crown in the dirt, diſmount's him as hee did <hi>Saul</hi> from his Palfrey, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. and the deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Jaylor in his profaneneſs and crueltie,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170649:23"/>
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 27. And thoſe killers of Chriſt <hi>Act.</hi> 2. ſaying, Lord, what wilt thou have mee to do? Oh, then hath wrath ſeazed upon the ſoul, when it hath killed this jollitie, and let out this pleuriſie out of it! And hence it is called, the Sacrificeing-knife, ſharper then any two-edged ſword, the killing letter, that which ſlew <hi>Paul,</hi> not by mortification, but by ſhedding the blood and bowels of ſins jollitie to the ground.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>effects</hi> of this terror are uſually three:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Stoopping in a courſ of evill.</hi> This differ's from the effect of providence, whereby the Lord doth limit the number and meaſure of ſin in the wicked for the preſervation of peace and civil ſocietie: For though that bee a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine work, yet it is not the immediate work of the law: but either a Providence without a word, or elſ by the general power of the word reſtraiing ſin: but this is a ſpecial kinde of reſtraint, iſſueing from the work of the law, for the good of the ſoul ſo reſtrained. And it is a loathſomneſs of the ſoul, findeing no joy in old courſes, beholding them with repenting and irking of thoughts, wiſhing them undon, and abhorring to return to them, through the terror of conſcience, beeing under this whip of the law.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:170649:24"/>2. The ſecond effect is, <hi>ſhakeing of a rotten peace: ſcil.</hi> falſ, ſecure peace which it take's to herſelf, when God debar's her of all ſound peace. <hi>Eſay 57. ult.</hi> A ſinners life is his rotten peace, both without a law, and with, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a law by ſumdrie practice and colors; <hi>viz.</hi> 1. By nuzling himſelf under flattering meanes. 2. Withdrawing from ſtirring ones. 3. Hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off conviction with obſtinate error or faneneſs, and coloring with half yeelding and and ſhew of conſent, the heart being rotten.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third effect of the law is the ſpirit of bondage. The Lord aime's by this to hold and keep the ſoul whom hee will ſave, from all revolt to former luſts and liberties. The ſpirit of bondage is the frame of a fearful heart held under ſlaverie and chaines of the law from all eſcapeing. As wee ſay, ſuch a man hath the ſpirit of mirth, or covetouſneſs in which hee is rooted. So the Woman is ſaid to have <hi>a ſpit of infirmitie,</hi> when her diſeaſ had ſo prevailed over her that ſhee was crazed by ha bit. So the <hi>Spirit of bondage</hi> Gal. 4. 7. is to bee one ſold to it that cannot get out.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> I. Of Admonition, to beware wee reſt not in this ſervile eſtate. For it differ's from true fear as much as from true libertie: for, 1. True filial fear is a load-ſtone to attract the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170649:24"/>
ſoul to God: this rather of it ſelf drive's from God. 2. This fear hath a reſpect to ſin as the occaſion onely, to puniſhment as a cauſ: as the ſlave look's not at ſloth, but at the whip. But true filial fear look's at ſin as the proper cauſ of fear, but at puniſhment as the occaſion.</p>
                  <p>3. True fear ſoften's: this rather harden's and imbitter's the heart. Examples in <hi>Joſiah</hi> and <hi>Ahab.</hi> 4. It hath exceſs in it, both for the conſtant aſſault of it without all intermiſſion in all places, duties and occaſions; and alſo for the dangerous inconveniences it bring's after it oftentimes: hinder's all fitneſs of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit both to dutie and in dutie, and defile's all. 5. It differ's from true filial fear, as doth the fear of an harlot and a loyal wife: the one fear's danger and hurt from her husband: the other reverence's him for love.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> II. Let none ſtumble at it; for although it bee no better in it ſelf: yet the Lord can mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, correct it and guide it ſo, that it ſhall bee a ſpecial medicine to prepare the heart for that which lightneſs and giddineſs would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able it from attaineing.</p>
                  <p>God's <hi>End</hi> in ſetting thus his law on work, is to make way for a ſinners reconciliation, which otherwiſe were not poſſible to work. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon catch an hare with a taber, as a wilde wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170649:25"/>
ſinner by the charm of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>This appeare's ſundrie waies:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By this meanes God joine's all wholeſom doctrine together. For it is not his purpoſe to leave the ſoul in this caſe, to ſeek out of herſelf after eaſ, ſeeing it's not in her power. But hee himſelf will have his Miniſter to join all doctrines together in the order of Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm both of remedie and miſerie, in their due order.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By this conſternation hee doth trie and wearie the ſpirits as in a Labyrinth, working them to an utter hopeleſneſs in themſelvs to bee better: that in ſuch a caſe the leaſt inkling of mercie might bee as newes out of a far coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That by the hear-ſay of it, their hearts might bee raiſed up to make ſerious inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after it, and not to periſh in their miſerie. When the Prodigal was brought to husks at the trough, then, and never till then, the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a father pierced him really.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>

For what is all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of a poor ſoul, when the promiſe is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred? Oh it's true, if I were loaden, I doubt not of eaſ! thou lieſt againſt thy ſelf, thou doeſt doubt of eaſ by the promiſe: for of the

former thou canſt not doubt haveing been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, caſt down and convinced by the law. That then which is the more eaſie to grant, the Lord work's firſt, as a part of the condition of Grace, that is to bee loden: that, when the harder com's to bee urged, that is, Faith, then the condition already wrought, might bee readie to comfort the poor ſoul.</p>
                  <p>2ly. Wonder thetefore at this wiſdom, which moſt fitly to the ſoul's condition, doth even work by contraries, life out of death, and order out of confuſion, and deſcant not by carnal reaſon againſt it.</p>
                  <p>3ly. In all the miniſterie of the Word, let the Miniſter and people of God, ſtill fix their eie upon the ſcope of God, moving on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with him; and going even pace with his ordinance, for the effecting of his own ends, and the glorie of his grace in our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Touching the firſt, it is called <hi>Legal,</hi> becauſ there is another and a more dangerous one by the Goſpel. This preſumption is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold: <hi>One</hi> this, when the ſinner waxe's bold

and venturous, to ſhake off this yoak of the law, before his ſpirit bee convinced and caſt down: this ſin made <hi>Adam,</hi> and all us curſed, even preſumption againſt threats. The <hi>ſecond</hi> is, when the conſternation of the law, ſeazing without addition of the Goſpel, cauſe's the ſoul to wax confident of it's own welfare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſ it hath been humbled, and perhaps hold's ſom impreſſion of it ſtill, not dareing to reſiſt her light. But this is rare, and where it is, dangerous.: for it's a ſign that the heart is ſecretly falſ.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond extremitie is <hi>Deſpair,</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending as much on the left hand, thorow the exceſs of terror.

Learn wee dailie to root this curſed root of bitterneſs out of us, by two things enſuing: <hi>Firſt,</hi> a Spirit of Humilitie and Fear to keep our ſelvs under the bondage of of our School-maſter rather then to affect the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of preſumers: and in ſo doing to beſeech
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170649:26"/>
the Lord to proportion out our ſtripes accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our ſtrength and to keep our deſpair within the compaſs of our ſelvs, and any thing in us: but to be far from the leaſt thought of enlargeing our baſeneſs above the infiniteneſs of mercie. <hi>Secondly,</hi> to nouriſh in our hearts above all, thoſe meditations of mercie and grace in Chriſt, which may ſet us upon a rock above our-ſelvs, and all fearful diſtruſt, and carrie us in the ſtream thereof with holy irreſiſtableneſs.

                  <p>The <hi>abuſe of the Law</hi> is double:</p>

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> on the <hi>right hand:</hi> many abuſe it, when they nouriſh themſelvs in a needleſs bondage, whereas they know they are in caſe to hearken after the remedie, and will not, pretending they have not been caſt down or troubled e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. What madneſs is this to nouriſh a diſeaſ againſt Phyſick? or to think that our trouble pleaſeth God? or to think that to bee of ſubſtance of Grace, which onely is for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> on the <hi>left hand,</hi> thoſe who do far worſ abuſe this doctrine, who beeing wearie of terror and bondage, aſſoon as they fall into it, caſt with themſelvs how they may

ſhake it off, pretending that this is no eſtate to ſerv God in: and ſo they return, ſom to their ſport and paſtimes, ſom to their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, ſom to their profits, ſom to their old companions.

                     <hi>Obj.</hi> Paul <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 7. ſaith: <hi>When the Law came, ſin revived:</hi> how then is terror the law's work?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Both may ſtand together in one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate man according to diverſ parts. For when the law had ſlain conſcience, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence revived: and wee muſt diſtinguiſh between the natural work of the law and the accidental. <hi>Terror</hi> is the proper work of it, and when it's wrought, it is as it ought to bee: but when <hi>rebellion</hi> ariſeth, it's otherwiſe then ought to bee. When the Sun ariſeth and ſweeten's the earth, it work's properly: when it drawe's up the noyſom ſtench of a dunghill to poyſon the air, it's accidental, coming from the loathſomneſs of the dunghill. So when ſin rebel's, ſhee doth her kinde: yet this rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion ſhall not hinder the killing power of it. It ſhall rather encreaſ it: for when the ſoul
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170649:27"/>
come's to ſee, how loathſom ſin hath made her, this make's her conclude her ſelf, out of meaſure woofull by ſin, and out of meaſure ſinfull. And when rebellion begin's to bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the heart growe's more and more under fear; although nothing hinder, why both may not at one time bee together. Onely in the bad, commonly it encreaſeth, till it hath caſt out all terror, and ſtrengthen's the jollitie of ſin. In the godly, the Lord will inlarge ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and conviction ſo far, that rebellion ſhall not ſtand it out, but ſtoop with confuſion under the power of it. <hi>Paul,</hi> by <hi>Sin,</hi> mean's <hi>Original ſin,</hi> bodie and members: by <hi>himſelf,</hi> hee mean's the powers of ſoul and bodie. <hi>Sin</hi> was <hi>alive</hi> in point of her ſtilneſs, peace and quietneſs, without any diſtemper: <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>alive:</hi> that is, merrie, jollie, luſtie, ſecure, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any fear. Again, note ſin's death, and <hi>Paul</hi>'s life, cauſed this deep conſent between them both: I ſay her quietneſs and his jollitie made them as cloſe as buckle and thong: For why? Sin was glad to ſee <hi>Paul</hi> luſtie: and <hi>Paul</hi> was glad to ſee her quiet. Thus it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them ere the law came. But how ſince? oh quite contrary. Sin revived, <hi>Paul</hi> died. How? Sin perceiving the law, reſolved not to give over, till it had divided her and <hi>Paul</hi>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:170649:28"/>
(who had ſo long lived at peace together, and traded with gain and pleaſure each by other) and to ſcour her houſ of her gueſts whom ſhee ſo corrupted, (the minde, the will, affections, conſcience and members of <hi>Paul</hi> beeing the creation of God) begin's to revive, to bee no longer quiet as before, when her trade proſpered, but to fret, rage and bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet. On the other ſide <hi>Paul</hi> alſo ſeeing the law alſo to gaſter him out of his wicked haunt, what doth hee? Die's, is all amort, forſake's his old miſtreſs, <hi>Concupiſcence,</hi> and begin's to bee wearie of his trade. Now, what is it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Paul</hi>'s dying, that ſin reviveth? what is it againſt the gueſt's ſhame and dying to their trade, that their old hoſteſs rageth? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion is in her, not in them: they are aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and flaited, though ſhee will know no law: conſcience and concupiſcence are two things.</p>
                  <p>Three ſorts of <hi>Rebellion:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Natural.</item>
                     <item>2. Penal.</item>
                     <item>3. Mix't.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Natural:</hi> when the Word or Law com's ſo to the corrupt Soul, that as yet it carrie's no power or authoritie over the ſoul with it, but ſtill the ſoul hold's her own: for then ſo
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170649:28"/>
cloſe is ſin and the ſoul, they ſo conſent, that to bee parted from their filthie fellowſhip is even death to them both, ſin incorporateing herſelf into the ſoul, that ſhee is as one with them, that it is as eaſie for <hi>Sampſon</hi> to part with <hi>Dalilah</hi> as theſe to bee ſundred: here therefore as both band in evill, ſo do they conſpire againſt all the lawes of God: it is as eaſtie to rob a Bear of her whelps as theſe of her ſinfull pleaſures. The Miniſter is to ſuch as the Marſhall in <hi>London</hi> is to Harlots: an ey-ſore, a reproach, a common wonderment. This is the firſt rebellion in the unconvinced. This is not here mean't.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond is <hi>Penal,</hi> a fruit of this, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encreaſed by the juſt wrath of God upon the rebells, whoſe chaines the Lord make's ſtronger <hi>Eſay</hi> 28. 22. by how much the more they kick againſt the pricks: I ſay, when the Lord penally ſmite's them, and ſuffer's them to encreaſ and fulfil the meaſure of their luſts to grow frozen in theſe dregs, deſperate in their luſts, ſo that they finde no place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting. See theſe texts, <hi>Mat 23, 32. 34. Act. 14, 19. Act.</hi> 28. 27. Neither is this meant here.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third is <hi>mixt:</hi> When rebellion is allayed with terror of conſcience, and not permitted to her ſelf: as wee know a thief in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170649:29"/>
hold is one thing, and at libertie, is another. This mixt terror is the accidental work of the Law, working corruption to a rebellion and reſiſtance, that ſin might bee odious and the ſoul more humbled. To apply then the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, I anſwer, This objection hinder's not this truth, That <hi>the proper work of the law is to caſt down and embondage the guiltie ſoul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Qu.</hi> How a troubled Conſcience, privie to much reviveing of corruption may diſcern that it cometh not from herſelf, but from ſin?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> This may bee diſcerned eaſily by many marks. <hi>Firſt,</hi> from the work of the law that hath ſeparated her from ſin, and that amitie which was between her and it.</p>
                  <p>This is no hard matter to prove, if once the ſoul can ſay, her old luſts and ſhee are divided by the law's terror: How can ſhee then think that ſhee ſhould rebell againſt the good law, for working that which ſhee is glad of.</p>
                  <p>2. It will will appear by this, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as true rebellion muſt com from a free will and principle of the agent: but that cannot bee conſcience, nor herſelf, becauſ ſhee is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by an over-ruleing law, which hath killed her freedon: therefore this rebellion is from ſin.</p>
                  <p>3. By this, that rebellion where it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convinced
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170649:29"/>
doth not onely fret in reſpect of ſomwhat ſhee is denied, but alſo at that which croſſeth her for it ſelf. But in this legal rebellion, when the ſoul is in chaines, the ſcope of this is as much in reſpect of that which is denied, as at the law ſimply.</p>
                  <p>4. Trie it by this; when rebellion com's from the ſoul, it encreaſe's ordinarily; but when from ſin, it decreaſe's, becauſ the Lord more and more weaken's her by terror of conſcience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> I. Let us from hence conceiv the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful eſtate of a wretch, ere the law com's in terror to him: hee and his ſin are in a curſed league, and commit hideous villanie together. As <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> ſworn brethren. My ſoul com no more into her counſel and conſent: how much better is the Law's little-eaſ, then ſuch Libertie of hell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> II. Let this teach God's Miniſters of the law to plie their tools. God hath put a weapon into their hand able (if well urged) to ſeparate even ſin and the ſoul: do not ſuffer this law to periſh for lack of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> III. It confut'es the world's aſperſion upon the powerfull miniſterie of the Law: they call it debate, and raiſing up ſtrife (as I ſaid) but oh yee lyars! wee do not envie your

neighborly peace, nor lawful conſent; but your cloſe league in your luſts: wee would divide you and your concupiſcence, that God might rule by that diviſion, whom yee barred out by your conſent.</p>
                  <p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> IV. Beware of all ſuch as nouriſh rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt the Law, in the point of her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pureneſs! if this rebellion here bee odious under terror, what is rebellion of ſin and conſcience jointly, I mean, wilful and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked? Beſeech the Lord to uſe any means, rather then ſuch rebellion ſhould be nouriſhed in thee! oh beg of God, rather hee would divide thy ſin and thee, by the hardeſt courſes then thou ſhouldeſt rebel againſt the Word for doing her office: Cleer the Law and ſay it <hi>is holie, I am the ſlave</hi> that is ſold under ſin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> V. Let it bee exhortation to all ſuch as God hath thus humbled, to bleſs him that hee hath choſen to tame the ſoul by terror, and ſtirring up of rebellion rather then to leav it to it ſelf. And let ſuch bee comforted in all their fears of their own rebellious hearts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Law of GOD, that the rebellions committed under terror, are none of hers, but ſin's work within her, which ſhee abhor's.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> VI. Mean while, let all ſuch comfort themſelvs in their rebellions of ſin: they are
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170649:30"/>
marks of Good, ſigns of the battering of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's and ſin's kingdom. Sin would never ſo rage, if ſhee were at as good peace as formerly. Beware of cloſeing the ſecond time with this harlot. Beſeech the Lord to nouriſh terro; though it bee not grace, yet it is a ſeed of it: pray him for a time rather to quaſh rebellion, then to ſuffer rebellion to deſtroy it. And bee of good chear: the Lord doth all this for good. When hee hath cooled and rooted out rebellion, hee will after a while root out ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror alſo, and in due time bring thy ſoul out of all her adverſitie, turning both into a ſight of the promiſe, and hope of the remedie. And thus much for the uſe of this point and obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from rebellion.</p>
                  <p>The general uſe of the former point of Terror.</p>
                  <p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> I. It may teach us to eſteem duly of ſin, according to her foul nature. For muſt it not bee a foul odious thing which ſhould bring in ſuch confuſion, as to turn the law of God which was given for comfort of conſcience, and rule of life, to becom the greateſt terror, and matter of vexation.</p>
                  <p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> II. To diſcover what ſin is in her kinde, when ſhee may act herſelf upon her own ſtage of ignorance. Shee is an hideous monſter.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> III. To all who would bee truly moulded by the truth thereof, in the fear of God, to look to themſelvs and take in kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and readily this point of the ſword into the boſom of their ſoul, that this ſpear may let out the water and blood of it, I mean, that quiet, jollie and ſecure heart in ſin, which hold's it as with cords, to bee content to bee ſlain, and to go into captivitie. Abhor then <hi>firſt</hi> to ſtand out in rebellion: put up thy weapons and fight not againſt God, whoſe naked arm is againſt thee. Abhor <hi>ſecondly</hi> a dead, blockiſh and ſenſual heart, not affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted nor moved with this voice. Abhor <hi>third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> a preſumptuous heart, which haveing heard of ſom hope, abuſeth it to foreſtall the Lord's work. Abhor <hi>fourthly</hi> all means of Satan, which might turn off quite, or daſh and quench this work. Yeeld not to the impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of recoverie, run not into deſpair, take not thought for thy ſweet ſin, God will make thee no looſer. Sculk not into corners to eaſ thy ſelf of this yoak: let God that put it on, hold it on his time, till hee hath trulie tamed thee. If it ſeem long, know there is a cauſ.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> IV. Let it teach us to pitie the looſ and jollie in ſin: oh! they make either work for hell, or (if God re-call them) for the law: for their chains muſt bee hereby increaſed, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170649:31"/>
they ſhall meet with a Jailor that will handle them accordingly. Oh! hear counſel betimes, the counſel of miniſter, husband, wife, parent, maſter, friend, yea childe, or ſervant, to yeeld to God at the firſt, that ſo thy yoke may bee the eaſier.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> V. Of exhortation. Burie not this work of the Spirit under theſe clods of fleſh: ſtreighten not the ſpirit of conviction. Beg of God that by all theſe ſix ſtaires thou maieſt fall lower and lower, till thou art brought to the earth. Ask thy ſelf, When Lord, ſhall my laughter, light, frothie, merrie, quiet heart bee met with thorowly? Lie under this work and ſuffer affliction. Say, I ſee the Lord is in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt; hell is no painted fire, the eaſ of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full courſ differ's from that little eaſ of the law: I am in a ſtreight, I know not whither to turn mee: No wealth, friends, credit, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, honor, eating, ſleep, play, or muſick can help now. Away now all old compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: the Lord hath laid ſorrow upon my ſoul: ſuch as no tales or jigs can put by: my meat is now mingled with gall, and God ſeem's to forſake mee: wrath, hell, and horror are upon mee, my nights are weariſom, and my daies miſerable. Chuſe rather to bee thus for the killing of thy fleſh, then at libertie for the

death of thy ſoul. And wait in this eſtate upon God till hee cauſ light to break out.</p>

                  <p>The Covenant of Grace is the promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and publiſhing of this his purpoſe, in and by his word, <hi>i e.</hi> by his Son, the eternal word of the Father: And this Covenant reache's equally to Election and no further, and the ſum of it is that GOD will bee their God, to pardon, ſanctifie, protect and ſave them, will not bee aſhamed to bee ſo called by them, nor of them to bee his own beloved, but hold them in this everlaſting Covenant of his, till hee receive them to immediate fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of himſelf.</p>
                  <p>There is another general Covenant of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary calling by the ofter of the Goſpel and the common badg of Baptiſm, which is made to all without exception (who exclude not themſelvs) but differeth from the former, and is much larger then Election.</p>

whence the purpoſe and alſo the manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof proceeded.

Therefore <hi>judg</hi> aright of this firſt love; and ſecondly profit by the meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of. Judg of it to bee the very fulneſs of all in all: to bee a length, depth, height, and bredth neither to bee reached unto, ſearched into, comprehended or attained: but onely by faith embraced and reſted upon.

bredth incomprehenſible were the fountain of it, (I ſpeak to a poor ſoul under the condition loden or loſt) what doubt is there of his love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee? If hee freely firſt mean't it and cut off the way of juſtice, and the bridg of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>that hee might not paſs it over, why ſhould'ſt thou think hee ſhould deſtroy his own work? why ſhould hee not bee willing to love thee, whatſoever thy ſin bee? and haveing loved thee eternally, what ſhall or can enter into him to change this principle in him, or cauſ him to repent?</p>

This will teach us to conceiv in what ſenſ the Lord doth offer us his Chriſt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us to believ, and promiſe us to eaſ us, if wee hunger, mourn, bee poor in ſpitit: to wit, that hee is far from intimateing any power, or will in us to concur with him in the leaſt of theſe, or to aſſcribe ought to him that willeth or runneth: but rather to ſhew what thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Graces are, which hee freely worketh in all whom hee will ſave.</p>

This will help us to judg, who thoſe parties are, in all likelihood, whom God will concur with and aſſiſt in the uſe of means tending to deliverance. Such is the baſe ſlaverie of man that hee diſtruſt's him ſooner in no one thing, then in that where in God offer's himſelf to the ſoul. As appear's in <hi>Manoah</hi>'s and <hi>Gedeon</hi>'s example. For though hee bee free and tied to none, yet (I ſay) with reverence hee tie's himſelf graciouſly to ſuch as do ſeek him, not themſelvs: for elſ ſhould hee contradict his own ends, which is blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.</p>

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170649:40"/>
of theſe two natures into one perſon: or, the aſſumeing of the nature of fleſh unto the ſecond perſon of the ſon of God, not to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it up, but to retain ſtill his own diſtinct nature, yet within union.</p>
                  <p>2. By <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> is mean't the calling or ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Lord Jeſus beeing thus united in his natures, to bee a meet Mediator: which was the ſanctification of him in time actually to the work of a Mediator, to which God before all time had deputed him.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Performance</hi> it ſelf ſtand's of two parts.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Either <hi>Meriting</hi> this price for all the Elect:</item>
                     <item>2. Or actual <hi>applying</hi> it to them.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The <hi>Meriting</hi> part conſiſt's of a double perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, both of <hi>actual obedience</hi> to the Law: and <hi>ſuffering the curſ</hi> required thereby and due to ſin.</p>
                  <p>And hee performed theſe two by way of real ſuretiſhip, and no otherwiſe: for takeing upon him the Perſon of a Mediator, to ſtand between wrath and us, not by arbitrement (as in humane ſequeſterſhips) but by paiment for us: Lo, therefore hee take's our perſon upon him, becom's piacular, that is, firſt ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with our ſin by imputation, that by his
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170649:40"/>
righteouſneſs hee might deface it, and fulfil the Law broken by us: and ſecondly, ſeazed with our curſ, that by his ſuffring death, hee might quit us of the fear and puniſhment thereof.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>Suffering,</hi> or <hi>Paſsion,</hi> hath two parts, the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> it ſelf, or <hi>Paſsion;</hi> and the <hi>Conqueſt</hi> or Victorie enſuing it, whereby hee gave the Paſſion a full power to becom, or rather to bee declared ſatisfactory.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Applying</hi> part, is, the act of his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedeing Mediation here on earth, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in heaven ſerveth to ſettle the merit of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption upon all the Elect in the due ſeaſon thereof.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are called <hi>well-ſprings of ſalvation, Eſay</hi> 12. 3. becauſ they are ſo many grounds of juſtifying faith. Their number is ſeaven: 1. <hi>Incarnation. 2. Divinitie. 3. Perſonal union</hi> with <hi>anointing</hi> attending it. 4. <hi>Actual obedience. 5. Paſsive. 6. Conqueſt. 7. Applying all to the Elect.</hi>

                  <p>I Branch: <hi>Incarnation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the power of the holy Ghoſt ſanctifying the fleſh of the Virgin, the Lord Jeſus beeing conceived in and born of the poor Virgin, did ſubmit himſelf to ſuch unſpeakable abaſement as to take upon him the nature of man: that in and by it hee might
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170649:41"/>
obey and ſuffer thoſe things which the divine nature could not beee capable off.</p>
                  <p>Touching this point obſerv further three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>realneſs</hi> of the fleſh of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus: hee took verie fleſh of verie fleſh, and not (as ſom Hereticks thought) a ſimilitude and ſhadow of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>differences of his incarnnation</hi> I. In reſpect of his father: hee was not ordinarily begotten by man, but by the holie Ghoſt, who fulfilled the work of a father. 2. In regard of his mother, a Virgin before and in and after his Incarnation. Divines make the Four dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of Generation: I. When man is made man without father or mother, as <hi>Adam</hi> in his creätion: 2. When man is made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a woman, as <hi>Eve</hi> was. 3. When man is made both by man and woman, and ſo are all her poſteritie made. 4. The laſt when man is made without either man or woman, and ſo was the fleſh of Chriſt made. Thirdly hee took our nature, the ſeed of <hi>Adam,</hi> and cauſed it to ſubſiſt in the ſecond perſon of Godhead.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Reſolution of ſom doubts about it,</hi> as, I. Why was it neceſſarie that our Saviour Jeſus ſhould bee fleſh? That hee might thereby bee fitted and accommodated for the work of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170649:41"/>
The Godhead could not ſuffer: the manhood could not merit infinitely: the Godhead therefore muſt merit by a fleſh that could ſuffer. 2. Why muſt the fleſh of a man and his nature bee taken to ſatisfie? The fleſh of a perſon could have reached onely to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal ſatisfaction: but the fleſh of our nature might ſatisfie for natue it ſelf, and all perſons contained under it. 3. Why muſt the ſecond perſon in Trinitie take fleſh? 1. becauſ the word of creätion and firſt ſubſiſting in creäted goodneſs, muſt alſo bee the inſtrument of the uncreäted. 2. It behooved, that as Chriſt is the engraven form of his fathe'rs likeneſs, and the brightneſs of his perſon: therefore ſo, hee ſhould bee the inſtument to bring us to partake the ſame image after wee had loſt it. 3 It was fit that the righteous ſervant and naturural ſon of God ſhould make us his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and obedient children.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. To confute Hereticks and Papiſts, who deſtroy the realneſs and truth of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of our ſatisfier, by their Ubiquitie, which deſtroye's the properties of the true bodie, and ſo the bodie it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 11. Of inſtruction teaching us to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie this myſterie of Godlineſs, Jeſus incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. It's a modell of the unſpeakable juſtice,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170649:42"/>
love, wiſedom of God in one, a far greater excellencie is in it then in the creation: It was, and is the ſong and wonderment of Angels: it was then, and ſtill is that which bring's glorie to God, peace to the earth, good will to men. It cauſed Mary to exult and to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie God, the Shepheards to report it, the Wiſe-men to travail after it, <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> to tremble, <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Anna</hi> to rejoice, and all the Church of God to triumph: and and ſhall wee hold our peace and want affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and admirations? Again, it ſhould teach us to caſt off all baſe carnal reaſons and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſts, either touching our ſalvation, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. Hereafter judg not God by outward apparences: in the fulneſs of 4000 yeers fleſh came: If the bodie of all promiſes bee com, how ſhall the branches bee performed? Hee that hath given us this deliverance, what can. hee denie us?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 111. Let us learn whither to go, when wee want any preferment in priveledges, or any grace to to furniſh our hearts or lives, or to fill us for our places, duties, and callings, or for uſe of odinances, eſpecially when wee are under ſtreights and bitter enemies. Let us bee perſwaded that our fleſh glorified in heaven, bear's ſuch ſtroak with the Father, that hee
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170649:42"/>
will hear him in all his requeſts: yea let us remember, that hee therefore took fleſh and felt all our ailes and infirmities, that hee might pitie us, and bee afflicted with us in all our affictions and temptations, as <hi>Eſay</hi> 63. 9. and will not let us lie under any ſtreights w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> hee can rid us off. For hee count's ours his, and our ſelvs his: and will do for us in this, as in all other things, as for his own fleſh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vſe</hi> IV. To exhort us to ſundrie duties. 1 In the difficultie w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> wee finde in the life of our faith, let us draw neer to the fleſh of our Mediator for influence and ſuccor: oh! how far off do promiſes ſeem to bee unto us? Chriſt is our peace in guilt of conſcience, ſtrength to ſuſtein us with patience in our croſſes: liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie from all bondage: ſufficiencie to enable us to walk with God, to crucifie corruption, to perſevere, to attain the reſurrection of the dead. 2. Again, it ſhould encourage our faint timorous hearts (ſo many as are loden with our burden) to com to the fleſh of this Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator for eaſ. For <hi>firſt</hi> in this fleſh of Chriſt there is a general fitneſs in him to receiv every one, whoſe nature hee beareth, for in that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture each perſon is encloſed. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it ſhould help our weakneſs in coming to God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by coming by this fleſh of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170649:43"/>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> let us com and plead our part in the Lord Jeſus for our portion of forgiveneſs and mercie. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> by faith com and draw waters from this well-ſpring of ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>II Branch: the <hi>Divinitie of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Lord Jeſus our Mediator was true God alſo.</hi> It was not onely the ſecond Perſon, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who took fleſh, but a Divinitie which enabled an Humanitie to obey and ſuffer, that God's juſttce might except againſt neither as inſufficient. The Acts and ſufferings of Chriſt (as fleſh) reckoned to his Divinitie made an equal ſatisfaction to God's offended Majeſtie. The influence and valor of the divine nature aſſiſting the humane, for the fulfilling of the merit: for if the Suretie fail in any point, his undertakeing is uneffectual. The Mediator then beeing to mediate between God and Man muſt needs bee God. 1. In reſpect of thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils hee was to expiate, as ſin and uncleanneſs. 2. thoſe enemies hee was to vanquiſh, as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, death, and wrath. 3. Thoſe good things hee was too purchaſe, eternal righteouſneſs, the image of God, and glorie hereafter in the preſence of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſn</hi> I. Let this teach us to adore the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Godhead of Chriſt, that wee reſt in no inferior object whatſoever the world can
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170649:43"/>
affoard us. But remember hee is God, bleſſed above all, and hath merited by his glorious power a glorious deliverance for his Church from death to eternal life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> II. This affoard's us a notable ground of underſtanding a real difference of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in Trinitie. God the Father ſend's God the Son into the world to ſave it by the power of God the holie Ghoſt, conveying and ſeale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his merit to the Soul of the Elect. Now except there bee admitted a real diſtinction of the perſons in Trinitie, how ſhall one and the ſame God for beeing, bee the partie ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, and ſatisfied?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> III. Of Exhortation to all that are loaden with their ſin deſireing eaſ: to com to this ſecond well-ſpring of ſalvation and to drink water of life freely from it, that is, believ it for themſelvs. Eſpecially let this beat down ſelf in us in the matter of our converſion. What ſhould wee bring to God for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption? can wee bring any light to the Sun, or drop to the Ocean? all fulneſs is his; hee muſt do all for and in us, before and in converſion. Again let us lay hold on Jeſus Chriſt, who hath ſatisfied God, and taken away wrath. Let this give a beeing and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of truth to all the promiſes of God in our
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170649:44"/>
ſoul. And let us draw neer with confidence to the God of promiſes: and comfort our heavie heart in the view of the hainous circumſtances of her ſin, makeing it out of meaſure ſinful. Bee not diſmaid, hee that is thy Suretie made not thy peace for ſmall and ſom, but all and the greateſt, ſo that thy thought muſt bee how to receiv this fulneſs, not for the greatneſs of this ſin.</p>
                  <p>III Branch: <hi>The Perſonal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Union of both Natures into one Perſon, by the unconceiveable work of the Spirit: it's much that Soul and Bodie, but much more that Fleſh and the Word ſhould bee really in one Perſon. The perſon of the Word took the nature of fleſh, therein to ſubſiſt.</p>
                  <p>It is called <hi>Perſonal</hi> Union, to diſtinguiſh it from other Unions in Chriſt, and all other Unions whatſoever. In Chriſt there is a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of Unions, but no perſonal Union in them. The Union of Chriſts Godhead with the Father and the Spirit is <hi>Eſſential:</hi> with his inviſible Church, <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Myſtical:</hi> with Water in Baptiſm, and Bread and Wine in the Lord's Supper, <hi>Sacramental.</hi> In other Unions, the things united are <hi>One,</hi> either <hi>by bare notional apprehenſions,</hi> as things underſtood by the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: or elſ <hi>One</hi> by <hi>compounding,</hi> as when of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170649:44"/>
three or four drugs is made one med'cine: or elſ by <hi>mixture and confuſion,</hi> as when Water and Wine are made one ſubſtance: or elſ by <hi>Divine inſtitution,</hi> as when man and wife are made one fleſh: none of theſe are perſonal Unions. But <hi>Perſonal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> is ſuch an one as whereby both natures ſo retain their diſtinct properties unconfounded, that yet they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main indiſſolubly united in the perſon without the leaſt ſeqaration, no not at death in the grave.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> I. This teache's us to conceiv aright of the perſon of Chriſt: wee muſt com to God, in and by the fleſh of the Son, the ſecond perſon. The equal tearm and object muſt bee the perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Union, <hi>i e.</hi> the Manhood muſt as truly bee praied unto and adored as the Godhead.</p>
                  <p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> II. It teache's us a difference between the ſubſiſting of Chriſts fleſh, and all other ſubſiſtings: wee ſubſiſt in the union of bodie and ſoul, which two make one and the ſame perſon: but the manhood of Chriſt is no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or ſubſiſtence by union of ſoul and bodie, but by aſſumeing the nature of man into the perſon of the Son of God: ſo that the fleſh hath no ſubſiſting at all, ſave in the upholding power of the Godhead: as the plant Miſſelto hath no root of its own to ſubſiſt in, but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt's in another tree.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:170649:45"/>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> III. To encourage the ſoul that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to draw neer to God for reconciliation and mercie in Chriſt, becauſ of the eſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it ſelf from God by loſs of image. Lo, the Lord is willing to unite himſelf unto thee (poor ſoul) in his Son, by vertue of his union with thy fearful &amp; frail nature. For by this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he hath purchaſed a ſpiritual union between himſelf and the ſinful ſoul. How ſingular an encouragemement then ſhould this be to a poor ſoul to faſten on the promiſe, when hee ſee's it aſſiſted by this all-ſufficient merit, iſſuing from the union of both natures, both ſuffering and meriting.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is a conſequent upon this perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal union: whereby the Godhead made the Manhood full of himſelf, and of all gifts and graces of the ſpirit, meet to enable him to his work of mediation, and by name, ſeparated him from men to bee excellent, as to bee the <hi>Prophet, Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>King</hi> of his Church. Hee was Prieſt to ſatisfie and pray for, Prophet to teach, and King to rule and deliver his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>

                     <p>The Uuction of Prieſthood is the chief part of the Unction of Chriſt, becauſ by vertue of that office hee performed the great work of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170649:45"/>
Two things are to bee conſidered in this <hi>Annointing of Chriſt our Prieſt:</hi> 1. The peculiarneſs. 2. The furniture of gifts. For the <hi>firſt,</hi> although there were many things in the ordinarie Prieſthood of <hi>Aaron</hi> which reſembled <hi>Christ</hi> for the general: yet becauſ there were many things verie different, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the holie Ghoſt ſet's him forth by the type of <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi>'s Prieſthood. For as hee was without beginning and end in his ſtorie, ſo was <hi>Chriſt,</hi> not as <hi>Aaron,</hi> mortal, mutable, ſinful. <hi>Secondly</hi> the Furniture which this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction filled the Lord JESUS our high-Prieſt withall, and that without meaſure. For as the fulneſs of the Godhead dwelt in him bodily, ſo all the communicable gifts and excellencies thereof dwelt in him. Eminent wiſdom, right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, humilitie, unblameableneſ,, holineſs, ſeparation from ſinners, and all other graces: but (as I take it) one fruit of his Unction was his peculiar fitneſs to ſatisfie. That holie, free conſent of his to the will of his Father to do, and ſuffer and fulfil all righteouſneſs: I ſay, this abſolute and unſtained Obedience to go thorow all difficulties, meekly, long-ſuffering<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, cheerfully, univerſally, and conſtantly, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptying himſelf to the death of the Croſs, was the main effect of this Unction, and the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170649:46"/>
of that infinite complacencie which his Father had in him ſaying, <hi>This is my well-belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> Son <hi>in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All the three Offices of Chriſt do conſpire moſt ſweetly together. The Prieſthood before the other two, becauſ elſ wee can have no right to them. But then the Prophecie and the Kingdom do return their aide to the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. Firſt the Prophecie teache's what the Prieſthood is, and by what order and degrees the Lord ſettle's reconciliation and peace upon a poor ſinner: open's the doctrine of Faith, and myſterie of Salvation. Then it teache's how to put on the Lord Jeſus daily, to apply him continually for forgiveneſs as our daily ſacrifice, and how to live by faith, and to bee guided in our particular courſ and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation according to knowledg. Secondly the Kingdom convey's the power of the Prieſthood into the Soul, and effect's that which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie teache's: and then haveing ſo don, it ſet's up a perpetual rule in the ſoul, giveing it power to obey both in doing and ſuffering, according to the truth revealed.</p>

few words will not ſerv, but God himſelf muſt emptie himſelf of his fulneſs and glorie; No other price will ſerv turn, but the Actual fulfilling all righteouſneſs, and the ſhedding of his heart-blood.

Let this Doctrine conſute, <hi>Firſt</hi> all Sectaries who teach that Chriſt had no guilt caſt upon him by juſtice, that Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred nothing in his ſoul from God's Wrath. Let us abhor ſuch novelties, and know, if Chriſt ſuffred no more the the malice of man, there remaineih a neceſſitie of a ſecond ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for us, from juſtice. Let us beware, while wee go about to mince and leſſen the ſufferings of Chriſt, wee dſtroy the truth of a Mediator, and bereav the ſoul of that which ſhould uphold her conflict with juſtice. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Let it teach us to abhor the opinion of thoſe <hi>Lutherans,</hi> who teach that wee muſt bee poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed wtth the verie ſelf-ſame righteouſneſs wherewith Chriſt obeyed and ſuffered; and this they imagine to bee the matter of our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, and that elſ God cannot in juſtice acquit us. But thus they make Chriſt ſerv for no other ends, but to make us becom our own
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170649:51"/>
Mediator, and to deſtroy his own. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it confute's thoſe Sectaries who affirm God ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no ſin in any of his, if hee have once im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Chriſt's righteouſneſs to them. This error ariſe's from not-diſtinguiſhing theſe two, Imputation of perfect righteouſneſs, and perfect imputeing or accepting of imputed righteouſneſs. No man is juſtified without the former, but our faith failing in the acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance, muſt needs bee looked on by God. I confeſs hee ſee's no ſin, but hee pardon's it to his in Chriſt, upon faith and repentance, but hee puniſhe's it for their good in mercie. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, what if wee grant, God ſee's no ſin in them in reſpect of their juſtification? Is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Sanctification perfect? Why then did <hi>David</hi>'s Adulterie diſpleaſ the Lord? or why do wee pray, <hi>forgive us our Debts?</hi> or why ſaith our Savior, ſay, <hi>When all is don, yee are unprofitable? Fourthly</hi> it confute's all ſuch as cut off the active obedience of Chriſt from the ſatisfaction, as they cut the garments of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s ſervants by the middle. It may bee gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, that the paſſive is the more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate conſummation of the ſatisfaction: but to exclude the active, is moſt audacious.</p>

could ſhun Hell, would never care for Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. God's people, although they could ſin unſeen and unpuniſhed, yet would loath it. They take as deep thought for God as for their own wel-fare. Shall a beleever reſt in his pardon more then in the righteouſneſs of God, which may make them accepted and beloved?

to teach it, and the people to applie it to themſelvs in all their fears, yea, the greateſt agonie, yea, death it ſelf. Whatſoever thou fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goeſt, hold this. Stand with open face, and hold this mirror to poor finners, that they may behold the LORD our Righteouſneſs. <hi>Secondly, to all People:</hi> Conſider yee who have truly felt that Serpent of the Law ſting yee mortally in the other part: com, applie the remedie in this: look upon this brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and live: and firſt, I ſay, feel the ſtrength: Secondly, take hold of it, and make peace for the former: Know, without a promiſe from God, there is no peace unto you: and promiſe there can bee none without ſatisfaction. This is the ſtrength of an offer and a promiſe. Anger abide's in God, without this price, and thou art but as the buſh, and drie ſtubble before it. Bee aſſured then no promiſe ſpeak's to thy ſoul, and to thy heart, except it hath this ſtrength of Chriſt, in whom each one is <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen.</hi> Hence com's all wrath to bee tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into love, and this will make God willing to offer, and faithful to perform, elſ not. That bottomleſs depth of mercie in thy Judg and Enemie cannot bee gaged without this bucket: by this thou maieſt reach it. Again, as this is ſufficient ſtrenth, ſo it is that onely which can
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170649:52"/>
redeem thee. Hee redeemed us, not with pearls, but with the precious blood of the Lamb: Wilt thou go to thy duties, performances, grace? Alas, they have no blood of expiation in them: all theſe will ſay, ſatisfaction is not in mee: where then? ſurely here onely.</p>

Whatever enemie purſue thee at the heels this is thy refuge, that here thou maieſt have ſtrong conſolation in all fears, againſt all ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: feareſt thou the ſins of thy youth, or age? The Lord Jeſus was conceived in the Womb, that the infant [Elect] which never ſaw light migt bee ſaved by him: Youth, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding her diſobediene, age for all her rebellion, might bee forgiven. Do thy moral ſins of murther, ſtealth, uncleanneſs, ſwearing diſtreſs thee? This Lord Jeſus ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled all righteouſneſs for thee. Do thy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual wickedneſſes oprreſs thee? an unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſecure, hard heart by the contempt of the goſpel? The Lord Jeſus ſuffered the powring out of his blood, to break the heart of thoſe that pierced him upon the Croſs. Art thou poor? Thy ſatisfier was ſo. Rich? Hee was the Lord of all. Are thy ſins great? Hee died
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170649:53"/>
for <hi>Noah</hi>'s drunkenneſs, <hi>Lot</hi>'s inceſts, <hi>David</hi>'s adulterie. Small? Lo, even thy leaſt vain word coſt him his life-blood. But perhaps not ſom ſins, but perhaps ſin it ſelf and the bodie of death trouble's thee: Hee was made ſin that knew none. Oh! then, whatſoever ſin can ſay, yet go on to the throne of grace, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 16. and look to finde mercie in time of need. Doth the Divell, gates of Hell, Conſcience, or the Juſtice of GOD threaten thee? They cannot ſave for ſin: if they do, thy conſcience hath her anſwer to God againſt all. And ſo plead this thy pardon to the Lord. Say thus, Oh Father, even thou cutteſt off thy plea in giving this price, in accepting it, in offring of it to mee; J (Lord) am here before thee pinched and damned by my ſin: if thou doeſt reckon it to mee. Oh! Lord, I put this bleſſed price bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween mee and wrath: Lord have no power to denie it mee. Even I, if I were left with an Orphan's eſtate, could not keep it from him.

                        <hi>GOD'S</hi> imputation of the merits of <hi>CHRIST'S</hi> righteouſneſs to a ſinful Soul is the formal cauſ of our <hi>juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>

                  </argument>
                  <p>IMputation doth import ſuch an act of GOD the Father ſatisfied, as doth take this righteouſneſs, and reckon it to the needing Soul as her own (although it bee inherent in another) to caſt upon it an eſtate of as full and perfect freedom and acceptance as if it had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſinned, or had fully ſatisfied: for look how he dealt with our Suretie, hee made him ſin for us, that is, imputed it to him as his, ſo doth hee take his righteouſneſs and count it ours, that it might bee really ours indeed.</p>
                  <p>This doctine of imputation is expreſſed by diverſ phraſes in the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:170649:57"/>By the tearm of <hi>not-imputeing ſin,</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteing righteouſneſs,</hi> hee intimate's in how many reſpects Chriſt hath holpen us, to wit, both to forgiveneſs in the one, beeing made ſin for us, and to acceptation in the other by cloatheing us with his righteouſneſs: yet ſo, as by both Active and Paſſive righteouſneſs jointly, not ſeverally conſidered.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>imputeing righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>imputeing faith for righneouſneſs</hi> is mean't one thing. Not that faith in any ſenſ can bee our righteouſneſs; but becauſ Chriſt apprehended by faith, is the ſame thing which faith it ſelf in the Scripture. Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, faith muſt needs concur with imputation in the act of it, and therefore the holie Ghoſt honor's it with the name of beeing imputed to righteouſneſs. For firſt, God enable's the ſoul to believ on the Lord Jeſus by the promiſe and the ſpirit thereof. Secondly, the ſoul yeeldeth and conſenteth. Thirdly, God caſteth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by this righteouſneſs (thus believed) on the ſoul, and impute's it to pardon and life: So in the point of juſtification, faith is ſaid to juſtifie, becauſ of her neceſſarie concurrence: which phraſe is tropical, the inſtrument bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put for the principal agent.</p>
                  <p>The iſſue of this imputation of God is the Act of God juſtifying us really and freely from all our ſin and guilt, and all the curſ due there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,

quitting us by proclamation (as I may ſay) from heaven, by the voice of his ſpirit through faith: ſo that haveing diſabled all enemies from giveing in evidence, lo, hee ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolveth us, as haveing nothing com in againſt us.</p>

Surely, though I dare not ſay theſe of thee, yet I ſay this: If all theſe had not the robe of Chriſt's imputed right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs caſt over the holieſt of all their Graces, their unhallowedneſs had defiled them, and the greateſt of their holineſs had not profited them. And lo, this robe thou haſt as fully, largely and deeply as the beſt of all theſe ever had. Thy righteouſneſs of imputation is as large as the largeſt of theirs. Again, touching thy fear of holding out, proov to thy ſelf thy faith in this act of imputation, and that thou haſt received that from God, and then I aſſure thee, that <hi>eternal Spirit by which the Lord Jeſus offred up himſelf</hi> for his Elect, (the weakeſt as

But the nature of faith (although it bee a gift put into the ſoul, yet) ſtandeth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a paſſive receptiveneſs, then an active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Secondly, in <hi>reſpect of the conſtancie of it:</hi> other graces, while they laſt, ſtand us in great ſtead, as patience under a croſs, thanks for bleſſings: but faith alwaies receiv's his impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Chriſt from the father, as well to cover and beautifie us all our life, as at our firſt converſion, and carrie's her influence into each grace, both to ſtrengthen and keep the life of it, as alſo to cover the wants of it, yea the defects of the whole courſ.

Remember imputation is not takeing all ſin out of thee at once (that muſt abaſe thy heart as it abaſed thy Suretie) but a not-imputeing it unto thee. Our bleſſedneſs ſtand's not in the want of ſin, but in the Lord not imputeing it. The buſh burn't, but the wonder was, that it was not conſumed. The Lord imput'es not thy ſin, cover's it, take's away the condemning power, impute's not the actual offences there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to thee. Hee look's at his own image in thee.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> hee offer's to the undeſerving. Wee were Theevs, Traitors and enemies: when wee did all wee could to pull him out of his throne, yea ſlew the Lord of life, then died hee for us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> hee offereth freely who offer's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly upon our need. No ſooner did <hi>Adam</hi> fall, but the offer followed: the ſeed of the woman, &amp;c. No ſooner doth a poor wretch need mercie, but it prevent's him. Ho every one, com, &amp;c. Hee that offer's leaſurely, is but a cold giver: but ſpeedie offring is double grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> when hee hath offered and given, hee repent's not. Of all works of which God is ſaid to repent him, it is neverr ſaid, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented to offer mercie. Nay, hee is ſo far from it, that hee hath ſworn and will not repent. God never repent's of mercie, that hee might repent us of our unthankfulneſs and unbelief.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> the Lord is exceeding glad when his offer is taken, and no way ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed, as when its in vain, 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 2 Heb,</hi> 2. 3, 4. No diſobedience is ſo odious to him as unbelief, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 19. Nor for which hee will ſo ſeverely puniſh, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. Hee is maſter of his
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:170649:61"/>
richeſt gift: count's it his honor to give the beſt moſt freely, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 27. Hee hath a royal heart, and can beteam to the baſeſt worm the priveledg of pardon, adoption and glorie: and hee giv's an heart capable of his offer alſo; elſ how could an oyſter-ſhell contain this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, all to teach the ſoul to recover it ſelf out of her curſed diſtuſt, and meaſureing the Lord and his gift by her ſelf and her capableneſs, whereas all his are inlarged by him with his offer to bee comprehenſive of it, the Lord makeing a poor ſhallow heart meet to receiv his fulneſs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seventhly,</hi> hee offer's without expecting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: as wee ſay, hee lend's freely who expects no requital: the Lord indeed look's for honor at the hands of his ſervants: but firſt hee giv's the gift; and ſecoudly the heart; and thirdly accept's it as honor, beeing no addition to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. The Lord offer's grace to none, whom rather hee might not bee aſhamed to own. Such is man's baſeneſs that even in his greateſt free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hee ſeek's himſelf. A father will give his childe his Land; but when? after death when it cannot pleaſure him. Till then hee will have rent. And wee have a ſecret end in our gifts, I give, that hee may requite. But the Lord offer's to ſuch as can no way content
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170649:62"/>
him, or bee pleaſing: Hee giv's firſt to make them ſo, but finde's them odious, that hee may ſhew what hee can finde in his heart to do, and make all men aſtoniſh't at his meer gracious grace, and to boaſt of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eightly,</hi> hee require's nothing in us toward the accepting his offer. All our own make's our accepting fruſtrate. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 22. Com and drink freely of the waters. <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. If any man thirſt, let him drink freely. God giv's, and upbraid's not our nothing. Nay our emptineſs is our beſt plea. <hi>Eſay</hi> 55. 1. Com and buy for nothing: ſelf denial is our beſt price; and hee that com's and offer's to God any thing, and bring's coſt to God, looſe's his gift.</p>
                  <p>This offer will appear ſo much the freer, if alſo wee mark the circumſtances in which the Scripture expreſſeth the offer, called the cords of love by <hi>Hoſea:</hi> by which hee draw's the ſoul to ſee his meaning, ſomtimes by his long patience and waiting upon her; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all her deafneſs of ear, and deadneſs of heart, and dallying with his offer. Oh! his locks are bedewed with the drops of the night! His long ſuffering and patience is a bottomleſs depth beyond all the expectation of man! It is long ere thy unbelief could wearie him; hee hath lengthened out the ſeaſon of grace, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170649:62"/>
to the length of grace it ſelf; forborn thee long, kept off judgment a long while, which might have ſwept thee away from hope many years ſince. Hee hath recovered the lives of many of us twice or thrice, that wee might renue our covenants and keep them. And hee hath ſpared us when wee have broke them, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in upon us with renuing of good motions and affections which wee had quenched, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loth to loſe us, giveing us helps and means even out of ſeaſon, after long contempt, confeſſing himſelf to mean as hee ſpeak's: Why lay you out your money, and not for bread, and your ſilver for that which profit's not? Hearken unto mee! eat good things!</p>
                  <p>So ſomtimes by his proteſtations of his loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that any poor ſoul ſhould periſh! Why will yee die oh yee houſ of <hi>Iſrael!</hi> Anger is not in mee, why ſhould flame conſume the ſtubble! What ſhould I do to my vine that I have not don? Somtimes by his paſſions and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations; <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 42. Oh! that thou hadſt ſeen, even in that day, the things that concern thy peace; but now they are hidden!</p>
                  <p>Thoſe tears and mournings over <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for her hard heart and contempt, have been and are ſtill over thee! If there bee any dampings and ſtreightnings of ſpirit, thou haſt cauſed
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170649:63"/>
them by thy dalliance and heart that would not repent. But the Lord for his part ſtill crie's, How oft would I have gathered thee as the Hen doth her chickens? Somtimes by his write<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to this feaſt of his Son, ſomtimes by his conteſtation,, ſomtimes by his entreaties and earneſt exhorting, ſomtimes by his allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to perſwade and toll on the heart that hang's off, by the promise of all the good things which hee offereth; ſomtimes by his ſevere threats to all that refuſe his offers: all theſe ſhew how willing and cordial hee is to part with his grace: and laſtly, ſomtimes by the univerſalitie of it, that hee diſpenceth it without all reſpect of perſons, age, ſexes, ſtates and conditions, who exempt not themſelvs. But the ſpecial properties of this offer are three:</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Libertie.</item>
                     <item>2. Simplicitie.</item>
                     <item>3. Fidelitie.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> hee offer's to whom hee pleaſeth, paſſing by millions of people in the world: ſo that it is meerly unconditional and free, as, when <hi>Paul</hi> came to <hi>Athens</hi> or <hi>Epheſus,</hi> who had never heard of the Goſpel before. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Lord beeing truly pacified in Chriſt offer's it ſimply hithout grudging, with an open heart,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170649:63"/>
meaning as hee ſpeak's. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Fidelitie, whereby hee doth moſt readily and fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form whatſoever hee offer's to all, who put him to the triall, and accept it.</p>
                  <p>This is the main hinge, whereupon the door of Hope and Faith turneth. For an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer is no otherwiſe differing from a promiſe, then as a general out of which a particular iſſueth: the promiſe is included in an offer, but yet in ſpecial, expreſſing the covenant of God to all that expreſs the offer, that hee will receiv them, bee their God, both in pardon and all-ſufficiencie. Into theſe the ſoul doth wholy powr out herſelf: which that wee may underſtand, conſider this; that wee have to do with the Father immediately, but with our Lord Jeſus onely mediately, as a mean to lead us with confidence to him. The Father pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly look's at the Son as our Suretie, and us for his ſake: but wee look at him directly; and to our Lord Jeſus, as our Mediator. So that look what wee can ſhew for our reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, muſt com from the Father, and that is his offer and promiſe, oath and covenant of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. Into that therefore the poor ſoul is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv it ſelf, all her doubts, fears, temptations and diſtempers whatſoever.</p>

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170649:64"/>
of God's juſtice againſt ſin, that hath ſtill left ſo many Nations in their utter darkneſs and brutiſh ignorance of the Goſpel. How ſhould this woful deſertion provoke us to prize the revelation of this Myſterie to us? as for them, how ſhould we pittie them?</p>
                  <p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> II. Secondly, this is terror to all <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> that maliciouſly hide and darken this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious offer of God in the Goſpel, from the eies of the blinde people; terror to all profane ſcorners, who reject the Goſpel, and prize their ſwine, their pottage, their pleaſures, eaſ and pomp, more then the Goſpel; reproof of all Non-diſcerners of this Grace of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, the feet of a Miniſter ſhoul bee beautiful in this main reſpect, (though others alſo) bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſ hee bring's glad tidings of peace!</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> III. Reproof to all that ſleight the Goſpel in the offer thereof, prefer their oxen and farms, their ſelf-love, ends and liberties before it.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> V. This ſhould ſcare all from infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and contempt of God's offer: Oh! it's free and from meer good will, the Lord is tied to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170649:64"/>
none; Hee hath rejected millions of Jewes and Turks and Baptized ones, and choſen to offer grace to thee. And, ſhall the contempt of the free offer of that which thouſands would have been glad of (upon the price of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from ſea to ſea for it) bee pardonable? Do but conſider what woful puniſhment will lie upon thee, who refuſeſt ſuch an offer laid in this lap. When as many poor ſouls would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice if the ſpending of dayes and nights might procure them a tender and believing heart to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv it; and yet complain, that they cannot com by it. Oh, tremble at the freedom of this offer! Bee humble and baſe in thy ſelf to conſider but this; I am a poor wretch, ſtanding to the mercie of a free God who hath it to give where hee will, and to denie it at his pleaſure. If hee give it to a prodigal ſon, and denie it to a moral civilian: if hee give it to one that came into the vineyard at the eleventh hour, and denie it to him that came in at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth: if hee denie it to the willer and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and bee found of ſuch as ſought him not, who ſhall alledg againſt freedom? May hee not do with his own as him pleaſe's? Oh! de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe none! leaſt the Lord make the deſpiſer ſeek to the deſpiſed, and bee glad of their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Oh! turn all emulation and ſcorn into
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170649:65"/>
humilitie, and deep adoring of this freedom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> VI. Dallie not with this offer of grace. There is a while of it, a ſeaſon annexed to the offer. The ſame breath which urgeth to receiv the grace of God, add's a charge: For hee hath ſaid, In an accepted time I have heard thee, and in the day of ſalvation have I ſuccored thee. Oh, that in that thy day thou hadſt ſeen! Now when is this day? Surely it is not the day of poſſible mercie, but of ſeaſonable mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: Then when as, (beſides health, means and the offer of grace) the Lord putt's a ſpecial ſpirit into the Miniſterie of the Word, ſo that it pierce's into the heart with perſwaſion: when the terrors of it are weightie and ſerious, the promiſe it is (as the early fruit in Summer) welcom and ſavorie: when ſin is bitter to the ſoul, and when it is irkſom to it, to bee out of God's favor: When the heart break's and mourn's after God, and can ſpend nights af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dayes in ſeeking: and it cannot bee quiet, but is held on by peculiar tenderneſs to attend grace.</p>
                  <p>Alas! there will bee a ſeaſon of God's wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs; and his ſpirit ſhall not ſtrive with man. Hee will have alſo a ſeaſon of leaving thee to that contempt, which deſpiſed the counſel of God for thy ſalvation. Abhorring of light,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170649:65"/>
preferring darkneſs, deſpiſing the Miniſterie and Ordinances, revolting from thoſe inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of grace which once ſeemed precious, I ſay theſe are ſpiritual wickedneſſes, and far exceed moral evils.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> VII. Let this bee a ſweet preparative unto us, to frame us to believ. Entertain wee not any baſe curſed thoughts of God in the ſimplicitie of his offer. Nouriſh all poſſible perſuaſion in the ſoul of his unfeigned mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards thee in this kinde: thou canſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor him no better, than to agree with him, in his meaning well to thee. There is no greater difficultie of faith then this ſeed of bondage in us, to judg of God by our ſelvs. Wee muſe as wee uſe. If wee have an enemie, wee cannot forget his wrongs, wee meet him not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out indignation: and therefore ſo wee think of God alſo to us, and the rather, becauſ hee hath ſo much vantage over us. But oh poor wretch, jealouſie aagainſt his love? Is it not rather oyl to the flame? Pull down thy trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's heart; hate not him whom thou haſt hurt; put on an holie and childe-like opinion of him, who when hee needed not, yet purpoſed, ſent, received this ſatisfaction for thee, and therefore cannot lie in offering it to thee. Say thus: Lord, thy ſweet offer, naked boſom,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170649:66"/>
cords of love, paſſions of ſick love, ſomtime to allure, ſomtime to conteſt, command, urge, threaten, and beſeech, turning thee into all forms of perſuaſion, to win my ſoul: all theſe convince mee of thy wel-meaning towards mee. If my own enmitie to my enemie, and the ſlander of Satan that thou envieſt my good, do aſſault mee never ſo much, and my own trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous heart conſpire with them, yet this thy gracious offer in thy Goſpel, ſhall bear down all. Read <hi>Eſay</hi> 55. 7. For my wayes are not as your waies, nor my thoughts as your thoughts: but as far above them, as heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the earth. Add this: All the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of man cannot comprehend the love of this offer, no more then the eie of a needle can the great Camel: and ſhall I go about to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen it?</p>
                  <p>Surely this ſhould bee a great ſtay to my heart, that God hath offered mee this grace; and as baſe as I am, what though it cannot enter into ſuch a narrow breſt as mine is, that hee mean's as hee ſpeak's: yet if it bee the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of a great God to give it (as his offer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port's) ſhall I look at my baſeneſs, or at his greatneſs, whom it were a diſhonor unto, to give mean things? Oh Lord, rather by this bountie open my narrow heart, and make it
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170649:66"/>
large. If the offer of a Miniſter of God bee precious, who dare ſeal it upon earth to my poor ſoul; ſhall not the offer of God himſelf, the ſtrength of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that cannot lie, much more ſway with mee! Oh Lord captivate all my hatred of ſpirit, and baſe treacherie againſt thee! It's reported of a certain Merchant of LONDON (in the ſtorie of <hi>England</hi>) that hee made much of a poor Cobler that dwelt with him, a cankred Papiſt, and did as good as maintain him; yet this Traitor went about to betray him to death: This Merchant have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſcaped his hands, yet out of his love uſed all means to bee friends with him again, and uſed him as before: all this would not do, his heart was ſo villanous, hee would ſhun the way of him, and not look at him. It fell ſo out at length, that hee met him in ſuch a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Lane, as hee could not balk him; but muſt needs talk with him. The good Merchant take's him to him, and told him, hee was glad hee had met him, and hee wondered what hee mean't ſo to decline from him. What ſaid hee, do you think mee your enemie? if I were, could I not cruſh you with a word ſpeaking? Alas, I am not offended with you, for all your trecherie, but forgive and forget it. The words of this man ſo pierced the Cobler's heart, that
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170649:67"/>
it brake inſtantly, and hee falling down upon his knees, and with bitter tears confeſſed his villanie, and repented of it: told him, This love ſhould for ever tie him unto him, and ſo he continued. This baſe Papiſt is the heart of every childe of old <hi>Adam:</hi> this royal Merchant is the Lord: this narrow lane is the ſtreight of conſcience beſet with ſin and curſ: this kinde behavior is this offer of Grace: Let us not bee worſ to it then a cankred Papiſt: but break our hearts, and melt into tears, and with <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>David</hi> ſay, Where ſhall a man finde ſuch love, as to ſpare his enemie when hee had him in his hand, and to bee content to cut off the lap of a garment, when hee might have cut my throat? Break my heart in the boſom of his love.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> VIII. Wee learn hence to underſtand the Covenant of God, a naked thing, but fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with all the merit of an eternal Satisfier, and with all the ſtrength, mercie, juſtice, and faithfulneſs of an unchangeable Promiſer, even the Lord fully ſatisfied; and ſo concerning it, beſeech the Lord, ſo to write it in thy ſoul. God's offer is founded upon Chriſt and the well-pleaſedneſs of the Father by him, Why then, there is no more anger in his heart, <hi>Eſay</hi> 27. 3. for if there were, what ſhould drie
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170649:67"/>
ſtubble do? But now, lo, hee is reconciled, hee cannot bee angrie with a poor Creature. Hee hath taken order to ſatisfie juſtice by his Son: to the end that hee might aboliſh the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Juſtice, and cut off his own advantage, and power to condemn. For a time hee was angry, for the iniquitie of thy ſin; but not for ever, leaſt fleſh ſhould fail before him. Oh! let us well obſerv this, That all in a promiſe and an offer is little enough to ſettle a poor ſoul againſt her fears. And this will cauſ us to bee glad to cling to the word and ſay, <hi>If I periſh I periſh.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>former</hi> is that by which the Lord finde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heart uncapable of a promiſe, bring's it and prepare's it to bee ſuch an one as may ſee it ſelf capable, and under condition of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſuch an one as may believ.</p>

For it's ſure, the ſoul can no more receiv ought from God, till it bee one with him by Chriſt, then Chriſt could merit any thing for us, till the Deitie and fleſh were really united: and no more then the bodie and ſoul can impart or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv to or fro, till they bee one. Till wee bee one with God in Chriſt, wee are without him in the world: The Lord abhorring all relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that want Union; but if once united, then hee is in us, wee in him; hee dwell's in us, wee in him, as an inhabitant in his houſ, and the ſoul in the bodie: hee is one with us, wee are of him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. in him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. fleſh of his fleſh; hee is our husband, and wee are his ſpouſ, and therefore hence iſſueth all virtue, vigor and power into us, that is meet for our ſupport, either earthly or ſpiritual, till our union bee perfected in glorie.</p>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> four things are conſidered.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1 The Neceſſitie of it.</item>
                        <item>
                           <pb n="135" facs="tcp:170649:70"/>2. The difference of creäted Union from gracious Union, with the cauſ of it.</item>
                        <item>3. How this Union is wrought in the ſoul.</item>
                        <item>4. The Effects which follow upon it</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with God is neceſſarie to all that would partake his graces.</hi> It was in the Creation, till the Lord had breathed the ſpirit of life and himſelf into him, <hi>Adam</hi> could have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God; ſo it is in this ſecond Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ätion; No benefit, no fruit thereof can com to the ſoul, till this ſecond creätion and union bee. But by this as by a channel the reſt follow, Reconciliation with amitie, Adoption with worſhip and libertie &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond thing is the <hi>difference</hi> of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nions.</hi> The Union of grace is not like that of creätion; neither in the meaſure, nor in the inſtrument of it. Not in meaſure: for in the creätion there was a total and immediate Union (in that kinde) and it was a perfect one, haveing God's image in it without ſet or impeachment. This Union of grace is an imperfect Union for meaſure in this life: bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſ the relicks of corruption and old Adam as droſs mixing themſelvs with the ſoul, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not God and it to knit fully. <hi>Secondly,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170649:71"/>
of Union are unlike. That of the Creation needed no other tie or band, ſave the immediate preſence of God in his image, which had then no ſin nor let to divide it. That Union, which now is encumbred with lets and enemies, muſt needs bee maintained by a band of greater perfection then any is in us.</p>
                     <p>The third thing is the inſtrument by which Union is begot in the ſoul: and that is (on our parts) faith; on the Lord's part, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of life in Chriſt, conveied by the promiſe and baptiſm.</p>
                     <p>The fourth thing is the effect of this Union, even in habiting and dwelling of the Spirit in that ſoul which is becom one with himſelf: ſo that now God in Chriſt by the Spirit, is that to the ſoul which before her luſts were, all in all, Lord and King, light and defence, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and happineſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> I. It is a terror to all hang-byes and time-ſervers, who have it at their tongues end, they are Gods, and they bee ſaved, how few ſoever they are. But they cannot proov it by any ingrafting or union. The old ſtock appear's in them, no planting into a new, no life of grace, no Chirſt to bee theirs, no bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to God by his fleſh and the union of it to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170649:71"/>
God, no promiſe to faſten upon, by which they may com: no Spirit of God to bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and to unite both, as the ſpirits Knit the bodie and ſoul in one.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>

All you that will needs claim it by u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, Trie your ſelvs about it: if yee bee uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God, then hath the Lord chaſed you from your wandring vagaries and old haunts, and brought you back like the prodigal.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> III. It's uſe of thankfulſs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to all God's people. 1. Of thanks; for who art thou that the Lord ſhould thus unite himſelf to ſuch a lump of earth and ſin? <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> comfort againſt all thy bad inmates and luſts which diſquiet thee, and make thee rather a Stie of uncleanneſs rather then an Houſ of God: Bee of good cheer; the Lord eſteem's thee not by theſe neceſſarie inmates, but by the voluntarie: Keep out them, and the Lord will look upon his pearls, not thy dung-hill.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> IV. It is to teach us, both what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitie and what dutie lie's upon God's people in this reſpect of their union. The dignitie muſt needs bee great, to bee one with God: for by this means all his and our things are common, hee ſuffer's in and with us in all our croſſes: Hee is honored or reproached in all our obedience or diſobedience: wee ſtand not,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170649:72"/>
nor fall to our ſelvs, but to him. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it's to teach us our dutie; <hi>viz.</hi> To bee ſenſible of this union continually, whereſoever wee becom. A wife that honor's her husband, will ſo carrie her ſelf, that her husband may not bee impeached by any unſeemly carriage, idle looks, ſpeeches, or liberties; ſhee look's at his credit whoſe ſhee is. Such a narrow eie ſhould this union with the Lord work in us: That his honor and name ſhould bee the mark wee ſhoot at, and look what wee think would jarr with his affections, trench upon his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that wee ſhould cut off.</p>
                     <p>III <hi>Regeneration.</hi> The order of Gods work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof is this. <hi>Firſt,</hi> the word preſent's to the ſoul her loſs of God, not in a few beams or raies of his, but his whole divine nature, life, and beeing. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it preſent's hereby the ſucceſſion of miſerie upon this loſs, and that moſt deſerved: all the curſes, wooes and penalties written in the law, are written alſo and engraven by the finger of God's convince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit upon this perſon as a book written all over, within and without. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the Lord preſent's this ſoul with her fearful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, in this reſpect, <hi>viz.</hi> that dangerous eaſ and quiet, which the deluded ſoul lie's in, in the midſt of all this privation of God. A
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170649:72"/>
moſt miſerable ſpectacle to behold, a creature miſerable, and yet thinking it ſelf poſſe'ſt of all; rich, cloathed, and furniſh't with all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> where the Lord will rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate to a new life, hee bring's the ſoul to the ſenſ of her lofs by the light of his law ſhineing as in a dark place (as the light in the morning diſcover's to a man robbed in the night of his treaſure at once, what a caſe hee is left in) and ſeaſe's it with a ſpirit of miſerie and beggerie, really ignorant now what to do, wringing his hands and ſaying, What ſhall becom of mee? how ſhal I live and paſs my life? how ſhall I avoid the pinch of beggerie, the ſhame of an undon man, and the ſorrowes that will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue? I ſay when once the Lord ſaveingly work's this, (for elſ it may vaniſh) hee doth in ſeaſon preſent the ſoul with the newes of ſecond life (to prevent utter ſinkeing) and ſtaie's the heart thereby. Hee ſhewe's it, that as loſt and forlorn as ſhee is, yet there is a way to reſtore her to her former integritie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                     <p>Now as touching this way, the Lord</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Touching the Order of it,</hi> hee tell's her, that foraſmuch as ſhee once had this image of God creäted in her, and hath wilfully loſt it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, before hee can reſtore her to it the ſecond time, his juſtice which is wronged by her ſin, and hath juſtly accurſed her for it, muſt firſt bee ſatisfied, and the ſoul muſt apprehend this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to herſelf, as her own: and by this means, her guiltineſs and curſ muſt bee waſhed off and removed out of his way: For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe how can hee and the corrupt ſoul bee brought together? What communion can there bee between ſin and pureneſs? <hi>Secondly. Hee enlighten's the ſoul in the way it ſelf:</hi> To wit, that in his wiſdom and love hee hath granted his own Son, true God, and the nature which was offended, to ſuffer the imputation of guilt, and the death which it procureth, in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and for the nature of guiltie man: and by this ſuffering hee ſatisfied juſtice to the full, ſo that hereby the way which ſin had ſhut up, might ſtand and lie open for the reſtoring of the poor loſt ſoul to her former nature and life of God again.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="141" facs="tcp:170649:73"/>Haveing thus enlightned the ſoul about this way, hee then <hi>applie's</hi> it to the ſoul; And that by a ſecond and cloſer work of his grace. For <hi>firſt,</hi> hee applie's this work of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>by the inſtrument of his word and promiſe,</hi> which is as a ſeed of Regeneration caſt into the womb of the ſoul by hearing it preached: As Saint <hi>James</hi> ſaith, Of his good will begate hee us, by his word of truth.</p>
                     <p>This word carrieth with it a forming power of the ſecond birth; even a creating of God in the ſoul again. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the <hi>efficient cauſ is the Spirit of Regeneration,</hi> taking this word, and caſting it into the ſoul, and there hatching and cheriſhing the ſame, till it have formed Chriſt therein, who is the ſecond <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> the true way, and life, that quickning Spirit. And <hi>thirdly</hi> hee effect's this in the ſoul by <hi>the power of Faith,</hi> which receiv's this ſeed of the word, and this quickning of the ſpirit: and poſſeſſeth the ſoul therewith.</p>
                     <p>Onely note this, that <hi>Faith doth theſe two things: 1. Firſt, it receiv's the way of this life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſoul,</hi> which is, the putting away of guilt and curſ which <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin contracted, and that is, pardon forgiveneſs. <hi>Secondly, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv's</hi> therewith and at once, the actual and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all properties and nature of God, to inhere and dwell in the ſoul.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="142" facs="tcp:170649:74"/>Now the ſpirit of Regeneration by this promiſe work's three diſtinct Acts and ſteps in the ſoul. Firſt, <hi>Conception:</hi> Secondly, <hi>Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Birth.</hi> By <hi>conception</hi> I mean, the leaſt ſtep to this life, by which the ſoul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's and keep's this ſeed of life: ſuffer's it not to paſs away and bee ſpilt, (as in hypocrites) but digeſt's and hold's the promiſe to it ſelf, till it have bred its longings after this life. Conceptions provoke longings of the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, luſting after a kinde of alteration of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual appetite, and a deſire after this life. This is that <hi>Eſay</hi> meane's <hi>Cap. 55. 4. Incline your hearts and hearken unto mee.</hi> That is, Bee ſo affected with this promiſe of life, that yee do incline toward it, and make to it, that yee walk in God's way appointed to bring you to it: Bee affected ſeriouſly with the excellencie of this life, and the happie change which God offer's you: that your ſouls do diligently enſue it in the means: That it ſtirr's the ſoul to mourn for ſo long liveing a dead life, and reſiſting the offer's of life, and reſting in a ſhew of a falſ conception: It doth long after this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great priveledg, to bee partaker of the nature and life of God: It uſe's all means which God hath appaointed with all earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſoul, reſtleſs till it obtain it.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond work is <hi>the quickning power of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170649:74"/>

                     <p>The third work of the Spirit <hi>is the birth of this ſperitual life:</hi> When the Soul com's out of the womb into the light, that is, diſcover's her ſelf to be alive, and apprehend's (as I may ſay) her own life, and that God hath begotten her to himſelf, which is the higheſt ſtep and decree of life which is bred in her. The poor ſoul haveing received the life of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, by her weak and poor faith, ſcarce felt and perceived, yet by the ſecret power of the Spirit, growe's from degree to degree: That although ſhee hath no other life at the birth, than in the quickning: Yet this life is more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent and ſenſible every day then other, till at laſt the Spirit fall in travel and bring forth Chriſt formed in the Soul, ſo that the ſoul ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear's to herſelf and to others, to live and to believ; becauſ now ſhee is in the light perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and brought forth: So that appear's in the operations and works of the new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</p>

up the beſt hopes thou haſt of life heer, ſo that the Lord would give thee ſound marks of true life. True life is a life of hope of Eternal life, yea lively hope: it rejoiceth under the hope of it.

                     <p>IV. Is <hi>Justification,</hi> which is contrarie to the ſtate of guilt and curſ by ſin. And by this benefit, the ſoul obtain's an eſtate of quietneſs and peace towards God. And that by a cleering and acquitting her at his Tribunal (as if ſhee had never offended,) fully, and perfectly. Which I add for a difference between juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and ſanctification, the former is an whole purging us from all our ſins, as Saint <hi>John Ep. 1. Cap.</hi> 1. 7. ſpeak's. The other a purging us in part, of which read <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. For purging is from guilt and curſ, and that muſt bee perfect by imputation (for elſ how ſhould ſinful fleſh ſtand before a perfect God). The latter is from the Dominion and Rule of it; which in this life is imperfect.</p>
                     <p>The iſſue and <hi>effect of juſtification</hi> is <hi>peace and quiet of ſoul,</hi> a moſt peculiar bleſſing: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to thoſe garboils and horrors which the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170649:76"/>
conſcience felt, being under wrath; as alſo to that rotten peace which the unconvinced conſcience walked with, through error: Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one, or other of theſe is the eſtate of all injuſtified ones.</p>
                     <p>Hence, the holie Ghoſt never ceaſe's to magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie this benefit, as <hi>Eſay</hi> 57. I create the fruit of the lips, peace to him that is neer, and afar off. It's a work onely belonging to God, and above the firſt Creation, for heer peace is made of a contrarie, even war. The Lord is the onely former of the conſcience, and therefore it's a work equal to God's power to create peace in it, and to reſtore it being loſt, is far greater; hee was anointed <hi>Eſay</hi> 61. to that purpoſe, to preach <hi>glad tideiugs (of peace</hi> Rom. 10. 15.) <hi>to the meek.</hi> For look how one ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent witneſs in a Court may by his verdict ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle a man's whole eſtate upon him; and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his right: So the Lord Jeſus by his blood, bear's witneſs that our ſin and curſ is gone, ſettleing Pardon and Salvation upon us, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cideing the queſtion, and making peace. And in this ſenſ wee read <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. That the <hi>blood of the Covenant ſpeak's better things then the blood of Abel;</hi> That cried in <hi>Cain</hi>'s conſcience nothing ſave revenge and horror; but this crieth peace. The like is that which I <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 20. the Apoſtle

ſaith of Baptiſm <hi>(the ſeal of this Covenant in the blood of Chriſt) viz.</hi> That it ſaveth us, not by waſhing away the filth of the fleſh, but by the anſwer of a good conſcience to God by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt. What is that? Surely this, that when the Lord ask's the ſoul in what plight it is, the conſcience ſtep's out and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer's, Lord, it's well with mee. It was as ill as could bee: but now it's as well as can bee. Thou haſt changed all in a moment, for in ſtead of war I have peace.</p>

Thou ſeeſt a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious object, a ſon of Peace. Hee carrie's that within his boſom, which coſt the Son of God his heart blood, which far exceed's all Gold and pearls; For why?

                        <hi>For the firſt,</hi> The <hi>benefit of Reconciliation of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by Chriſt,</hi> is the firm, ſolid agreement and friendſhip of the ſoul with the Lord of heaven, who before was our deadly adverſarie. For the opening whereof, ſurvey a little theſe few branches.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> from hence iſſueth a Covenant of God made with the ſoul, and of the ſoul with him. <hi>Deut.</hi> 26, 17, 18, 19. The Lord hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouched thee this day to bee his peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as hee hath promiſed thee, &amp;c. A ſweet text. As the Lord diſclaimed and diſavowed us in <hi>Adam:</hi> ſo by the reconcilation of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam</hi> hee vouchſafeth and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to bee his.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> hence our behavior and courſ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com's acceptable, as <hi>Abel</hi>'s ſacrifice for his perſons ſake, was accepted: ſo that in all our ſervice &amp; allegïance we are wel-pleaſing though in him whom firſt God was wel-pleaſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> hence alſo flow the moſt excellent favors and graces of his Spirit conferred upon us, that hee might the more take pleaſure in us, as a Bridegtoom doth in his Bride and ſpouſ whom hee hath and adorned.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> the All-ſufficiencie of God as as a fauntain is ſet open by this ſluce of Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170649:78"/>
For hereby the Lord can beteam the ſoul all ſupport, and all that is needful for this and a better life. And this All-ſufficiencie reacheth to ſoul and bodie. All things are yours, as you are Chriſts, and Chriſt God's.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> the Emnitie of the whole frame is reduced to an Amitie with them: there is a league made with heaven, earth and hell, that nothing ſhall hurt them Heaven ſhall not bee as braſs, nor the earth as iron. The beaſts of the field ſhall bee at league; enemies ſhall turn friends, becauſ their waies pleaſ God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> it reſtore's us to our blood (not onely to our dignitie in perſon, but) in our poſteritie,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Seventhly,</hi> hence iſſueth the gift of perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, to bee endued with a loyal ſpirit, and with faithfulneſs, never to depart from the fear of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eighthly,</hi> hence iſſueth a ſweet Reflex of this Amitie of the Lord with the ſoul, a very pledg of that felicitie in heaven, which ſhall fill the glorified ſoul in the ſight of God: Faith (I ſay) preſent's a privitie and conſciouſneſs of this holie agreement with God, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable ſecuritie of heart and ſoul: which none can utter, ſave they that feel it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> the <hi>way how the Lord confer</hi>'s <hi>it,</hi> and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170649:78"/>
that is by the ſpirit of Reconciliation in the Word, working by the embaſſadors of it. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. whereof there are four ſteps: 1. By this ſpirit the Lord diſcover's and preſent's a light to the Soul in the right colors, (and in the glaſs of the Law) of her in-bred and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall contrarietie to God and trecherous enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of ſpirit: ſuch and ſo deep, as doth perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually fight againſt him, yea reject the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of amitie offered by him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> hee diſcover's himſelf to ſuch a ſoul, that hee hath afforded to her a price of reconciliation, even the blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: not onely to compound and mitigate ſom extremities of Enmitie, but even to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it all, and nail it to his Croſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> if this prevail, to break and ſhew to the ſoul the bottomleſs love which lay hid in the boſom of God, who was in Chriſt, and is in the Spirit and Word of Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> the Spirit of Reconciliation fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten's the offer of being reconciled to God, upon this poor ſoul by the inſtrument of faith, the beſt make-peace that ever was; which faith, over-power's the enmitie of the ſoul, by the exceſs of amitie and mercie in God: and (as it were) compell's it to bee reconciled: Shee
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170649:79"/>
apprehend's ſo much compaſſion in the boſom of God, as to drown all enmitie therein as in the bottom of the ſea. And ſo to kiſs the Son, ſwear allegiance, and com in.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>third</hi> thing is the Uſe of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>

Tell a favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite whoſe life reſt's in the Princes favor, that his Prince is out with him, and his breath is ſtop't, yee choak him! What a plight was <hi>Haman</hi> in when his face was covered? Tell mee if God's favor bee as life, What is his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie?</p>
                     <p>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> II. This is inſtruction to teach all ſorts the excellencie of this priveledg. No o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther amitie is like it; onely in this, and by it, other amitie is bleſſed: But all other is but dung to it.</p>
                     <p>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> III. Let it bee an uſe of trial to us, whether wee bee reconciled. If wee are not, wee are curſed. If wee are, then this Covenant hath drawn from us an Oath and Covenant with God again. As the ſingular Amitie of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> begate a Covenant and a renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it with an Oath of God. Oh! ſuch a ſoul will ſwear to keep God's righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170649:79"/>
and to walk in all well-pleaſing. This is the laſt mark of all: as our Savior ſaith, <hi>You are my Friends,</hi> Joh. 15. 14. <hi>if you do whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I command you.</hi>
                     </p>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> IV. Improov this benefit. Seeing the Lord will have us his beloveds, and crown us with ſuch favors, let us not decline them. Do as favorites do with Princes: they chuſe favor above all boons, becauſ it is the fountain of all.</p>
                     <p>

brought into the world, and for his ſake the Angels are Miniſtring Spirits for the good of us, and of ours. The Father acknowledg'd Chriſt ſaying, <hi>This day have I hegotten thee.</hi> So doth God in him acknowledg thee for his childe, and himſelf thy father: The Father made Chriſt the Heir of all things; and all things which thy father hath are thine, as thou art Chriſt's. Chriſt was pittied and heard by the Father in that hee feared, and thy father will bee afflicted with thee in all thy afflictions. Chriſt was faithful in all God's houſ as a Son, fulfilling all righteguſneſs. If thou bee a ſon, what, ſave thy faithful fear and obedience ſhould proov it? The Lord Jeſus beeing the Lord of all, yet denied all; even to a Pillow to lean his head on, and an Hole to hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in.

                        <hi>Redemption</hi> is oppoſite to two things: <hi>Firſt,</hi> Thraldom and ſlaverie to ſin, and ſo to all ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who by ſin ſtrove to hold the Soul under fear and bondage. <hi>Secondly,</hi> to the ſting and dint of all ſuch croſſes as ſin hath brought
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170649:83"/>
into the world, as the tokens of God's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure for it. <hi>The first Redemption</hi> ſet's the ſoul at libertie from all that ſervitude and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie, it buy'es out and reſtore's the ſoul to the libertie of releaſed and ranſomed ones: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it free onely to righteouſnes and that for ever. From hence iſſues's an heart enlarged to God: ſo fearing him, as fearing nothing elſ. Hence <hi>ſecondly,</hi> floweth a right to the Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Providence of God. And <hi>laſtly</hi> to theſe two may bee added freedom to God's ſervice, to finde it an eaſie yoke, and a light burden; yea, to count it our happineſs to denie our own wills, becauſ bodies and ſouls are bought with a price, that wee ſhould not bee at our own, but at his will that dearly bought us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 15. Chriſt hath bought and redeemed us: I. From Sin. 2. From all our Enemies, Satan, the Law, bondage under Cerimonies, Death, Wrath and Hell, unto freedom of Righteouſneſs. The concluſion of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is, That <hi>Redemption is a peculiar bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, wherewith Chriſt is offered to the Soul,</hi>

Know yee, that till the Law hath left you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Spirit of this Bondage, to count your ſelvs as yee are, and lie under this eſtate, as ſenſible of it, and in your ſelvs paſt hope, Cain's and Judase's caſe is not more woſul then yours.</p>

Sin is no ſuch tame and harmleſs beaſt as you imagin. Nothing but this blood of Chriſt is able to ranſom you.

                        <item>1. Either in God's ſaveing his from afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</item>
                        <item>2. Or his ſuſteining them in and under them:</item>
                        <item>4. Or his delivering them out of them, and that either in part, or finally.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>They are all three expreſſed in the 63. of <hi>Eſay, verſ</hi> 9. by name. <hi>The Firſt,</hi> The Angel of his preſence (Chriſt, as <hi>verſ</hi> 1.) ſaved them, and bare them on his wings continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. <hi>The ſecond,</hi> In all their afflictions hee was afflicted; (that is, ſuccoured and upheld them). <hi>The third,</hi> In his pittie and mercie hee redeemed them, (that is, delivered them).</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The firſt</hi> is uſually called the protection of God over his own in Chriſt their buckler and ſhield: in which ſenſe it is ſaid, The beloved of the Lord ſhall dwell under his protection

all the day long. It is God's people ſcape all ſuch croſses as befall the wicked, as wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> I. Oh! how patient ſhould wee bee in ſuch croſſes as befall us in all kindes, if wee conſidered, that the greateſt part of them which light upon us, is not the leaſt of them that paſs by us?</p>

Of his meek and patient ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial. 3. Of his courage to bear and endure. 4. Of his innocencie and good cauſ to defend them. 5. Of the Spirit of prayer, which crie's and grone's to him that can eaſ them. 6. Of purgeing power, whereby Afflictions prepare us for glorie 7. Of the iſſue of the Croſs, even the quiet fruit of righteouſneſs. 8. Of Victorie before-hand, even while they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Croſs. 9. Of patience to wait till the hour of darkneſs bee over.</p>

Is it not a mercie to bee thus cared for and pitied as children, when the Lord put's the wicked to their ſhifts? and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard's not what betide's them: <hi>Saul</hi> falling upon his ſword deſperately, <hi>Ahimelech</hi> thruſt through, <hi>Achitophel</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> hanging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs? Is it not worth the while to ſee a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Soul at his death lying as a Lamb, as a Preacher, as one burning but not conſumed; above fears, above loves, hopes, wife, children, world, ſelf? able to doe any thing through Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth and ſuſteineth?</p>
                     <p>3 <hi>The third is Redemption</hi> or <hi>deliverance</hi> from Croſſes, either particular ones, or all. The Lord hath his healing in his wings even here for his people. I grant there is a right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous <hi>Abel,</hi> who periſheth in his righteouſneſs, But ordinarily when God's Maſtick patch hath dried the rheum, it fall's off of it ſelf. <hi>David, Moſes</hi> had an end of their croſſes, and as <hi>James</hi> ſaith, Yee have heard of the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Job,</hi> and what end the Lord made. Long ſickneſs, long povertie, long perſecutions, have had their end. There is a day for us if wee can wait. How many weak complexions in youth have enjoyed healthy age? how many
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170649:86"/>
priſoners have been looſed? how many poor ones bin enriched? how many mens later daies have proved better then the firſt.</p>
                     <p>But becauſ all redemption goe's not afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, therefore there is another Redemption far more ſure, and that is full and final at their death and reſurrection, wherein all tears ſhall bee wiped away.</p>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> I. This ſhould make all afflictions ſeem light in compariſon, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. and cauſ us to embrace it by hope, ſaying, If our hope were onely here, of all others wee were moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. A <hi>Church Conſtituted</hi> is gathered by the Word, profeſſing the ſame truth, doth enjoy the free, peaceable &amp; ſetled uſe &amp; adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all eſſentials to ſalvation, the Word, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments and outward Aſſemblies eſtabliſhed by Chriſtian authoritie. And contrarie to this is that Church which conſiſt's onely in toleration and connivence, doubtful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetled.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A <hi>Church Viſible</hi> is an Aſſemblie of ſuch worſhippers of God, as enjoying the libertie of the Ordinances, do partake them viſibly,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170649:89"/>
audibly and ſenſibly to the eie and obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of man.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>Church Inviſible</hi> is that Communal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or fellowſhip of the Elect of God (when, or whereſoever throughout the world in all ages and times), as, beeing called to God, and given to Chriſt, becom his myſtical bodie, and are built up unto one habitation by the Spirit. Shee is called <hi>Inviſible,</hi> not as if ſhee conſiſted of ſuch members as may not bee ſeen and bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converſed with, ſeeing that they do uſually reſide in the Church Viſible, worſhipping God with others externally: but becauſ that by which ſhee ſubſiſt's is an inviſible grace of the Spirit, not ſenſible to the eie of man, but known to God alone, and to others onely by the judgment of charitie, more or leſs.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>Militant Church</hi> is that part of the inviſible, which here upon earth walketh and warreth with, and for God againſt all his and her enemies, according to that vow and oath ſhee took in her Baptiſm, or preſt-money, wherein ſhee covenanted to bee God's faithful Souldier againſt World, Divel or Fleſh.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The <hi>Church Triumphant</hi> is that inviſible, which haveing caſt off her harneſs after the victorie obtained, abide's in ſoul with God, and triumph's there over all conquered ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie;
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170649:90"/>
both theſe (although in diverſ ſtate) are the ſame Church.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The <hi>Church Malignant</hi> is that ſpecial kinde of Church Viſible, which although it retain's Baptiſm and ſom ſuch truths as are of the Eſſence, yet hath degenerated in the moſt of her <hi>tenets</hi> from the truth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
                  <p>Now, the <hi>Church Inviſible</hi> is the equal and onely ſubject of Chriſt and his benefits: One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with this difference; that although the whole Church enjoy all, yet becauſ the Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant differ's from the Militant in the fulneſs and poſſeſſion, the one by ſenſ, the other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the aſſurance of faith and hope, therefore here wee eſpecially aim at the Militant, as it contain's the whole armie, the ſouldiers, the bodie of his members.</p>

to honor even the Church Viſible. Diſdain not her aſſemblies, ſeparate not from her members, renounce not her fellowſhip: prize the field highly wherein the pearl is hidden.

The bodie hold's the members, the Vine the branches, not they them. Bee not high-minded but humble thy ſelf, and be leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer then the meaneſt of the members. The Lord hath beſtowed life and bleſſing upon his Church for ever, <hi>Pſalm 33. ult.</hi> not upon thee in ſeverall. Thy grace is a member's grace, as the blood of a finger, and the ſenſ thereof, and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:170649:91"/>
the ſpirit thereof is from the heart, liver and brain, carried to the bodie, and thence deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to each part. Humbly therefore bee glad to receiv thy part, ſee thy wants, ſupplie them by the bodie, and diſdain not the grace of the meaneſt: for if thou abide in the bodie, it's thine and thy ſupplie.</p>
                  <p>II. The Adjunct of the Church of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Adjunct of the Church</hi> is the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints and members of this myſtical bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Chriſt, which is nothing elſ but the due entercourſ and holie fellowſhip, recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally between member and member, for the good of the whole.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>1. <hi>Qualification, generally</hi> ſtand's in this, that they bee <hi>brethren.</hi> No ſooner is a man a believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and a new creature, born to God, but hee is alſo a <hi>brother.</hi> No baſtard, no ſtranger, no <hi>Gibeonite,</hi> no blemiſh't one may enter the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this Communion. More <hi>ſpecially,</hi> they

have the true <hi>Spirit of brethren,</hi> of members, by which the former is manifeſted to bee true.</p>
                  <p>Wee muſt know that this Spirit of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is the priviledg of the whole Inviſible Church, before it bee the ſpirit of any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar member: for, the members draw ſpirit from the bodie, as the bodie from the head. Now this ſpirit is flowing from Chriſt, who hath therefore ſhed his blood for his Church, not onely that hee might unite it together with it ſelf, but alſo that it might edifie it ſelf in love. And the Lord Jeſus hath obteined this Spirit from his Father.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Spirit of Communion</hi> may bee diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in theſe two particulars.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. By <hi>ſeparation of falſ parts,</hi> or contrarie, which threaten ruine to her. Mettals melted will go together and unite their ſubſtance, but ſever the droſs which is of another nature from incorporateing with them, the Citizen of the

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>By gathering together of new.</hi> This preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit is alſo a drawer of like parts to her ſelf, for the filling up and ſtrengthening of Communion: ſhee is ſtill aiming at the bodies increaſe: and therefore as the waters of the ſea win upon the banks, ſo doth this ſpirit of Communion ſeek out and enlarge her borders. Our Lord Jeſus the head of this communion, ſpent his life in gathering members to this bodie. <hi>Peter</hi> gathered 3000. at once: and each member of it doth, or ought to becom all in all to gain ſom.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>By preventing of any thing hurtful to herſelf.</hi> This Spirit is warie to defeat whatſoever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts may bee made againſt her communion either by oppoſite perſons, or properties.</p>

                  <p>Such are</p>

                  <p>I. <hi>In Graces:</hi> In the tradeing whereof theſe rules muſt bee obſerved:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> bring in thy ſtock into this bank: each member in this ſtaple of Communion muſt get the gift of exchange: hee muſt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a due entercourſ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Humilitie is an excellent mean to exerciſe communion in graces: <hi>condeſcending to men of low degree.</hi> Proud ones get little, and do little in this communion of Saints.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Covet others graces, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 31. Covet the things that are moſt excellent. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite after the graces of communion is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct of God's ſpirit, for the growth of Graces. Men that hunt the Bezar, ſeek not her fleſh, but that which is precious in her, the ſtone which is ſo cordiall. Baſe reſpects are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the Saints in regard of this jewel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly, extract graces from others. Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 6. There is wiſdom in the heart of the wiſe, and a man of underſtanding will
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:170649:93"/>
get it out. <hi>Delilah</hi> lay at <hi>Sampſon</hi> till hee had told her his whole heart. So ſhould'ſt thou that ſeekeſt the grace of others. <hi>Firſt,</hi> by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thy caſe in their perſons whom thou tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt with, as if thou wouldeſt learn what pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience in ſickneſs and pain is, or how thou mighteſt die well, ask others, how ſhould yee do in this caſe? make mine your own. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> obſerv wiſely what fall's from the godly in their communion and converſation: over-ſee not their words, behaviors, affections, zeal, ſcopes. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> let faith bee the chief extractor. <hi>All things are yours,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul:</hi> meaning all graces in all the members: it's a great help of profiting when as wee believ all the graces of others are ours, allotted us by priviledg from Chriſt whoſe wee are.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Reſt not onely in the outward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but pierce into the inward. There is more in a Saint then a bare ſentence or carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age will expreſs. Look into the bottom as the Cherub into the mercie-ſeat.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Bee wiſe to chuſe thy object. Each man excell's not in each grace or gift. And when wee meet not with that wee look for, wee think meanly of men as <hi>Naaman</hi> did, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing croſſed by <hi>Eliſha.</hi> But the Graces of God are to bee marked as they bee moſt eminent:
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:170649:94"/>
As in <hi>Moſes,</hi> his meekneſs; in <hi>Phinehas,</hi> his zeal; in <hi>Abraham,</hi> faith.</p>
                  <p>II. <hi>In Meanes or Ordinances.</hi> Theſe edifie the Church, <hi>Firſt,</hi> as they are ties and bands of Communion. <hi>Secondly,</hi> as they are active inſtruments or helps to beget and nouriſh it.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>As ties and bands.</hi> Pſal. 122. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is called a compacted Citie, knit together by the Aſſemblies, by the Sacrifices, by the Thrones of Judgment. <hi>Act. 2. 46. The Church continued and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lave together,</hi> in the uſe of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, the ſacrament eſpecially of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Experience teacheth that the fellowſhip of the Word, Praier, and the like, is the life, ſtrength, blood and marrow of communion. Wee ſee that the common ties of nature, edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and place do much tie men together: to have had one father, to have lyen in one womb, to have dwelt in one town, to have fed at one board, to have been brought up in one familie or nurſerie, are bands of fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, how much more all theſe ſpiritual ties in one?</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>As begetters and nouriſhers of Communion. Firſt,</hi> as for the <hi>Word preached</hi> how many thouſands did one Sermon of Peter gain to this Communion? And it no leſs preſerveth and holdeth the faithful therein. For eieher
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:170649:94"/>
it finde's them ſtaggering in this Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then it reſtore's them: or ſad and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, and then it encourage's and comfort's them: or ignorant, and then it enlighten's them: or unruly, and then it admoniſhe's them: or ſtanding, and then it eſtabliſhe's them: So that it doth all offices of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Secondly,</hi> ſo the <hi>cenſures duly adminiſtred</hi> and the like. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> ſo the <hi>ſacrament of the Supper,</hi> how active an inſtrument it is to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile them that bee at odds, and unite them more who are brethren? <hi>Fourthly, Prayer:</hi> what office is there w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> it hath not don the Church? what was the means of converting <hi>Paul?</hi> what delivered <hi>Peter</hi> out of <hi>Herod</hi>'s priſon? &amp;c. <hi>Fifthly, Faſting</hi> joined with it, what good thing hath it not don? a key to open the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of heaven, and to bring upon the bodies and ſouls of the faithful plentie in famin, victorie in war, protection in dangers, eaſ in diſtreſs.</p>
                  <p>III. <hi>In duties and ſervice.</hi> Theſe are of two ſorts. <hi>Som</hi> concern the <hi>bodie, viz.</hi> Charitie. <hi>Som</hi> the <hi>ſoul, viz.</hi> Holie example, ſavorie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, admonition, reproof, correction of errors, exhortation and quickning to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, comfort in heavineſs, ſickneſs and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, and in each ſpiritual reſpect, wherein
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:170649:95"/>
member may bee uſefull to member.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> I. Warp from the Communion of all Popiſh, prophane and excommunicate ones from this fellowſhip: complie not with them, turn from all inordinate, malitious, ſcandalous, revolting and prophane ones: true communion abhor's ſuch.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> II. It's Admonition to all of God's houſhold to beware leaſt any bitter root riſe up in them to defile this communion. When there were not above <hi>four</hi> or <hi>five</hi> in the Church, how did Satan pollute them; as <hi>Cain</hi> againſt <hi>Abel, Iſmael</hi> againſt <hi>Iſaac, Eſau</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Jacob,</hi> to overthrow communion? ſo doth hee ſtill. Again, Let it admoniſh God's people alſo, that if by any occaſion Satan hath caſt in any bone to divide them, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them to wrath, heart-burning, diſtemper: that they preſently caſt it out and repent, leaſt the breach grow greater. And let the falling out of ſuch bee the renewing of love. Let them ſo much the more narrowly look to themſelvs after, to prevent the like, that ſo they may nouriſh the communion of Saints in the bands of peace.</p>

the bodie: let not this dead world cool grace in us.</p>

               <div n="7" type="article">
                  <head>ARTIC. VII.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>That every <hi>Soul</hi> make this deliverance his own in ſpecial.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>Whoſoever by the former part hath been convinced by that of his ſin, and been kindely pinched and prick't thereby by each of thoſe Articles, ſo let everie ſuch ſoul be now alſo convinced of <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> and believ himſelf to bee the partie to whom this delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Chriſt belong's, by each of theſe five Articles promiſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> What is it to believ this?</p>
                  <p>Anſw. <hi>To believ this is the Work of the Spirit of</hi> GOD, <hi>by vertue of which a Soul under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Faith, doth caſt it ſelf and relie upon the offer of God, for pardon of ſin, and for Eternal life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The condition of Faith</hi> is ſuch a qualification, as God require's of one who may believ the promiſe of reconciliation to belong to him.</p>
                  <p>That which God aim'es at in offering mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, is the magnifying of his Attributes of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:170649:96"/>
Mercie, Juſtice, Wiſdom and the reſt, which hee will have more to appear in man's Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, then they could in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Integritie. Hee will have the eternall doors open them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs, as hee ſaith, <hi>Pſal. 24. ult.</hi> not that our own ends, forgiveneſs and happineſs, but the King of glorie might enter in: even as hee or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained our Lord JESUS not to obey and ſuffer for any ends of his own, but meerly the Fathers to whom hee was ſubject: as wee ſee in <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 3. and therefore he would have him loſe all glorie, and emptie himſelf, that hee might fulfill the ends of him that ſent him.</p>
                  <p>The Lord uſually proceed's by theſe ſtep's.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Where the Lord will work kindely, hee will ſo preſent the glorie of his grace to the ſoul in diſtreſs, that, whereas before it was under confuſed deſpair; <hi>Firſt,</hi> it ſhall ſee a crevis of light, and an hope a far off of a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible deliverance: which hope ſhall melt and diſſolv the heart into a ſpirit of mourning and breaking, not ſo much for fear of hell, as for the Lord himſelf. See it in <hi>Jona.</hi> 3. compare <hi>ver.</hi> 9. with <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7, 8. when once hope began to ſpring up ſecretly, who can tell whether God will repent him of his fierce anger, that wee periſh not? Lo, they melt into tears, they
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:170649:96"/>
faſt put on ſack-cloth on themſelvs and their beaſts, and make a rufull ſpectacle. So doth the ſoul here leav takeing thought for it ſelf, and take thought for the Lord ſaying, O wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man that I am, whom the Lord ſhould bee found of, when I ſought him not! who had care of my happineſs, when I cared neither for him, nor for my ſelf!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Soul reſt's not here, but break's out into deſire, that it might live to glorifie his grace, and partake of it, that it might ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie it before all the world, and give wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to it againſt all deſpiſers of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Soul ſet's an high price upon this ſalvation, and recount's the ſeverals of it, that it may ſee the unvaluableneſs of this pearl, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 44. haveing ſpied the pearl, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe's it ſelf, hide's it, ponder's the worth of it, viewe's the particulars of it, as one would do of a purchaſe, and by ſo muſeing of it, ſet's the whole man a fire with it, in the eſteem and value thereof.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It laſtly emptie's the ſoul of herſelf.

the net, when hee could catch nothing, was amazed: ſo doth the Lord in this caſe. Hee cauſe's that loathneſs and reſiſtance of that proud heart that ſavor's no grace or faith, to quail and fail utterly, take's away the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ſelf, and ſelf-love which is offended at his grace. Eſpecially it turn's away the ſoul from her own ends in ſeeking ſalvation: ſhee dare's not now aſcribe to her own duties, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, praiers, affections, preparations, but caſt's them into the ſea, that life may bee preſerved. Shee feel's the great ends of God's glorie to work all theſe in her, but no way as works commending her to God, but as ſparkles of the Spirit of Grace, which by theſe ſteps drawe's her home to God, becauſ hee will ſave her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe I. Terror</hi> to all that dream of their eſtate to bee good, when yet they lie in their ſins as whole men: they think Chriſt is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them barely; <hi>Bee reconciled to God,</hi> bee they what they will bee. And in this they are the more ſtrengthened by the opinion of ſuch Divines as diſlike theſe preparations. The which opinion as it take's away the benefit of triall and comfort from many poor ſouls, who would fain finde the leaſt ſeed of faith to bee begun in them, and keep's them long at a
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:170649:97"/>
dead point with themſelvs for lack of faith it ſelf: ſo it nuzzle's many hypocrites in a conceit of themſelvs, that bee they what they will, yet they may be reconcil'd at their pleaſure. Again, all ſuch as remain blinde and dead-hearted blocks in the midſt of this grace of the Goſpel, they ſee no light, nor feel any warmth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, but ſtill are cold Snakes, and are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affected with good nor evil. Where is the hope of your faith, where no dram of the condition of it is wrought? <hi>Thirdly,</hi> to all dalliers with the ſeaſon of this grace, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off this rich offer of God, pinn'd on their ſleev; thinking they might have God tied to them, and becauſ they have taſted of his grace with the tip of their tongue, therefore they may have it at their command; wheras have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once deſpiſed it, they grow further and further from it daily. They ſhould have learned that the condition of faith is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to faith: Dallie with the one, and forego the other. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> to all hypocrites, that reſt in ſom appeareance of theſe prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, not wrought in them by the ſpirit of Grace, but from their own principles: which appear's in this, that if they bee reprooved, they cannot endure it, dare not enter into the triall of their mournings, deſires, and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170649:98"/>
proov them to com from the ſpirit of Grace: but love their own eaſ better then the rules of God, and while their own pangs laſt, who but they? but when their own ſparkles bee out, then full of ſorrow. No conſtancy, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſelf-denial can bee found in them: grace is nothing worth of it ſelf, except ſom mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their own concur with it. A ſign they have felt little ſweetneſs in it, and therefore are far from beleeving it.</p>

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:170649:98"/>
to hinder them, and the divel to com be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween cup and lip, that they might not drink of that cup of ſalvation. Oh remember, it's mercie to bee brought within theſe ſuburbs of heaven. Bee thankfull for any thing, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally a pledg of faith: nay bee humble, and ſay, Lord, what ever is not hell, is from mercie. I will rather comfort my ſelf, that the Lord meane's mee the fulneſs of this earneſt: rather then grudg that preſently I have not my will, and ſo wax wearie of waiting. And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> this ſhould expell ſlaviſh fear from them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſ the Lord hath given them a condition of faith. Beware yee do not abuſe it. Pledges are well kept by honeſt men, not ſpoiled. Do not tempt God by your diſtruſt: nor ſuffer the good preparations of the Spirit to die or wane, through boldneſs, looſneſs, worldli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, pleaſures; leaſt God make them as bitter to you, as <hi>Samſons</hi> dallying with his har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> IV. It diſcover's the ignorance and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of ſuch Miniſters and people who though they bee not leavened with Poperie, yet part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from confounding mourning and ſorrow with repentance, and partly from blindeneſs and error of the common ſort, teach and think that repentance muſt goe before faith,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170649:99"/>
and here they flouriſh exceedingly; for (ſay they) What? doth not <hi>Peter</hi> ſay, Repent and believ? Think you that Chriſt will dwel where corruption is? Muſt wee not repent, becauſ the kingdom of heaven is near? Will God meddle with ſuch as live in their ſins? Hence they mightily urge mortification of Luſts, before wee dare apply Chriſt, &amp;c. But Oh yee blinde guides of the blinde! See you not how under colour of your devotion you overthrow Chriſt? What uſe is there of Chriſt, if our ſins (before wee believ) muſt firſt bee mortified? ſhall Chriſt die for ſin al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie mortified? can wee diſpoſe our ſelvs to grace, when as all that is in us is graceleſs? No: Chriſt muſt bee, not onely before our mortification, but alſo before our believing; yea, before our preparation to beleiv. Oh! but <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, bid's the people to repent, becauſ the Kingdom was at hand. I anſwer, This objection com's from meer ignorance of the text: For that Repentance there ſignifieth onely a penitencie of heart, irking the ſoul for ſin. And yet Chriſt onely is the worker of it. And it is a preparing grace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, raiſed in the hearts of all that God will ſave. It confound's the order of ſanctification, w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the order of Regeneration; For although
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:170649:99"/>
Mortification go before Vivification, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance never goe's before faith.</p>
                  <p>Now, <hi>to cast the ſoul upon a promiſe,</hi> or, <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev,</hi> is the laſt work of the calling ſpirit of God, whereby an humbled ſinner doth caſt himſelf upon this word of God, Bee reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, com and drink, com and I will eaſ you, or the like offer, will, charge, or promiſe of God for pardon and life. This point is of all others the chief, and therefore I chuſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to this place, as the uſe of all that hath been ſpoken, jointly conſidered; for wee know, a five-fold cord is not eaſily broken, and yet no one twiſt thereof might well bee ſpared.</p>
                  <p>Five divers grounds have been handled in this ſecond part:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God the Father our enemie hath cut off his plea, and found out our deliverance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Lord Jeſus accordingly hath ſatisfied the juſtice of God; that mercie might have free courſ by the procuring of a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God the Father accept's this for a poor ſinner as if hee in perſon had ſatisfied, and therefore offer's it to the ſoul moſt unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, without hook or crook.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Hee offer's him not nakedly, but with all
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:170649:100"/>
his rich furniture, to draw the ſoul to faſten upon him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Hee offer's him to each poor member of his Church, there to dwell for ever both in grace and glorie. Now to conclude; I demand, what one link of this chain were not ſtrong enough to draw the heart to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle it ſelf upon it? And yet I muſt ſay this, That the word and promiſe of God is the immediate thing which faith relie's upon: although ſtrengthned with all the reſt</p>
                  <p>To this conſideration two things general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are required.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The one,</hi> to gage the promiſe and offer of God, as a Marriner would ſound the depth of the ſea, leaſt his ſhip ſhould bee on ground; ſo ſee whether it bee able to bear the weight of the ſoul or no, and anſwer all her diſtempers and fears fully.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſecond,</hi> if it appear that it is able to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein it, then to relie and caſt it ſelf upon it confidently, for her own pardon and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Although the Marriner cannot himſelf by his own fadom touch the bottom of the ſea, yet by his line and plummet hee can ſound it as well, as if hee could reach it with his hand, and ſo faſten his Anchor upon it: So here, the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170649:100"/>
plummet and cable of the Word, wherein this ſtrength and depth lie's, will help us out ſo far as may ſerv our turn. The hand of faith touche's the depth of mercie conteined in the offer, by the direction of the Spirit in the Word, which tell's us what is conteined there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
                  <p>Three things the Soul muſt look at to bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom it ſelf upon the promiſe of reconciliation and deliverance. Firſt, the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of the Lord. Secondly, the <hi>Strength.</hi> Thirdly, the <hi>Faithfulneſs:</hi> All which are ſure grounds the Lord hath hidden in the promiſe of mercie to a poor ſinner, that is under the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Wiſdom of the promiſer.</hi> I may ſay of it, as the holy Ghoſt ſaid of <hi>Salomon,</hi> when hee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for a ſword to cut the childe: All <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaw that God had put the Spirit of Wiſdom into him to do juſtice. So, God hath ſhewed all wiſdom in the promiſe, to ſettle the ſoul. And that in two reſpects: <hi>Firſt,</hi> of himſelf. <hi>Secondly,</hi> of us; in reſpect of himſelf, becauſ in revealing his heart of love to the ſoul one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hereby, and no other way hee teacheth us, that hee who is God onely wiſe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 17. could in the depth of his counſel finde out no other way ſo wiſe and ſufficient as this, to
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170649:101"/>
ground the ſoul in ſure peace towards him: Chriſt, and the promiſe in him, was that, which ſeemed the wiſeſt of all waies, in the thought of God, eſpecially to us under the Goſpel. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1. After ſundrie waies the Lord ſpake unto our Fathers in dark times, as dreams, Urim, viſions: but now by his Son and Word, the engraven form, &amp;c. Note how this courſe is called the beſt, &amp; wiſeſt and holdingeſt of all, as haveing more in it then all the reſt. Oh! wee would think in our ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſs that one from the dead, Angels or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations were better. But wiſdom it ſelf hath pitch't upon this way (all things conſidered) as the wiſeſt of all. <hi>Secondly,</hi> in reſpect of us, for it is ſuch a way as call's us to faith, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe haveing relation to believing it, without which it cannot profit us. Now if it bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us, how wiſe a way is it to quaſh and damp our baſe ſpirit of ſelf-conceit and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endeavor, and to abaſe our Pride, that hee who boaſteth might boaſt in the Lord? So that the promiſe is like a Map which a wiſe man ſhewed once to a fool that boaſted of his lands, bidding him to point out his lands in the Map: which being narrow hee could not do, and ſo went away aſhamed. Note then for this, <hi>Firſt,</hi> wee all would bee counted wiſe:
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:170649:101"/>
many in theſe daies chuſe to bee counted ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſhoneſt then unwiſe. Well, let us then bee wiſe for our ſelvs, and wiſe to ſalvation in chuſing this way of a promiſe to ground our ſouls upon. Wee ſee not the Lord: But if this bee a wiſer way then that, think there is ſomwhat in it then at firſt might ſeem more and faſten upon it.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>The ſtrength of God:</hi> Read 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. The ſtrength of <hi>Iſrael</hi> cannot lie: meaning in his word. So then in the Word of God is his ſtrength alſo, enough to bear up the poor ſoul in believing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. Hee bear's up all (the weight of the World) by the word of his power. How much more the weight of a weak ſoul? See <hi>Eſay</hi> 27. 5. Anger is not in mee, there is a word. What follow's? Or take hold of my ſtrength, and make peace: <hi>q. d.</hi> if I bee reconciled, there is ſtrength enough, and that for a ſinner to take hold of: either this or nothing, Read 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20. For all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God in him are Yea and Amen, that is ſure and ſtrong, but mark how? In him the words that I ſpeak are ſpirit and life. But wherein is this ſtrength? Surely in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named grounds of this ſecond part: Chriſt's ſatisfaction, the Father's acceptation, are thoſe pillars of ſtrength to a promiſe, without
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170649:102"/>
which it would not avail to go to a promiſe. Weigh ſeriouſly that noted text, 2 <hi>Corin.</hi> 5. 20, 21.</p>
                  <p>The Miniſters of God in his Name offer and ſeal up, in the Word and Sacraments that word, bee reconciled to God. What ſaith the ſoul to this? I dare not, God is a conſuing fire. True ſaith <hi>Paul;</hi> but anger is not in him. Why? becauſ hee hath made (and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) him that knew no ſin, to bee ſin, that wee might bee the righteouſneſs of God in him: hee that ſaid, In him I am well pleaſed. Shall a poor ſoul bee then as <hi>Noah</hi>'s dove upon the waters? Why ſay yee to my ſoul flie to the hils, if God bee his ſtrong hold? If thou bee under the condition of the promiſe, hee is no leſs in his promiſe. Take a ſimilitude. A man lie's in priſon for debt of an hundred pound. A friend com's to him, and bid's him com out: hee anſwer's, I cannot, I lie here for debt; and then there appear a ſtrength unto him, and laying hold of it, hee com's out. Read that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. God hath ſet him forth to bee propitiation: that hee might bee juſt in juſtifying him who is of the faith of Jeſus. What ſaith the poor ſinner to this? Oh! but it is juſt with God to puniſh ſin whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever? Nay, haveing made and accepted him
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:170649:102"/>
the propitiation for a broken ſoul, it is even juſt to pardon him. It was mercie to grant ſuch propitiation: but haveing ſo don, it is alſo juſtice to pardon: even as it is not juſt to take one debt twice. Therefore <hi>David</hi> plead's, Pardon mee according to thy righteouſneſs: Chriſt haveing turned juſt wrath into juſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. To conclude this, note yet a ſecond ſtrength in the promiſe: for the poor ſoul ſtill cavill's. But this is to a believer, I believ not. I anſwer: But the promiſe (by the power of the ſpirity of our Advocate) is able to do that which it required: it's not a killing letter as the Law, Do this and live: but a quickning one, Believ and live: it giv's that it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand's: the ſoul being under a promiſe, is under the autoritie of him that bid's her bee reconciled. It is as with <hi>Naaman, 2 King.</hi> 5. 15. Waſh and bee clean: ſo hee waſhed, and lo, his fleſh became as a childes. <hi>Act.</hi> 3. That crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that beheld <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> being bidden to ariſe, felt ſtrength and ſtreightneſs to com into his limbs; How? In the Name of Jeſus, <hi>verſ</hi> 12. This name of Jeſus is much more in the promiſe of Reconciliation, Mark then; if the ſtrength of the promiſe bee ſuch, ſay not, it is nothing, but take hold of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="200" facs="tcp:170649:103"/>3. <hi>The faithfulneſs of God,</hi> the faithfulneſs and undeceivable unchangeablenſs of it: this is a ſtrong bottom, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 25. This is a faithful ſpeech, and worthie of all acceptation, Chriſt came &amp;c. Read that ſweet place <hi>Eſay</hi> 55. 3. The ſure mercies of <hi>David,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of it, <hi>Heb</hi> 6. 18. Surely bleſſing I will bleſs thee. Wherein God willing more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly to ſhew to the heires of his promiſe the immutabilitie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of his Counſel, confirmed it by an Oath, that by two immutable things, (Covenant and Oath, in which it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for God to lie,) wee might have ſtrong conſolation: why? Becauſ they are as two Cities of Refuge to a poor diſtreſſed fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſoul (in the purſuit of Satan and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thoſe two avengers) to lay hold upon. Mark then, if the Lord deſcend ſo low to a poor ſinner, as to anſwer all doubts, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding an oath and a ſeal of his Sacraments, and a pledg of his Miniſters faithfulneſs, to aſſure the ſimplicitie of his meaning: then doubtleſs it muſt bee his honor to perform it, and hee that believ's it not, muſt needs make him a lier, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 33. as hee that believ's ſet's his ſeal to the word, that it is true. <hi>Num.</hi> 22. 19. It came from a wretch, yet by God's Spirit. God is not a man, that hee ſhould lie. Oh! then
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:170649:103"/>
bottom this ſoul upon his faithfulneſs. Read <hi>Eſay</hi> 54. 9. Haveing made this covenant of mercie with the Church hee add's, This is as the waters of <hi>Noah</hi> unto mee: for as I have ſworn that they ſhall no more deſtory, ſo I will bee wroth no more with thee: with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting kindeneſs I will ſhew mercie upon thee. And again, If my Covenant with the Sun, and Moon, and Stars ſhall fail, then ſhall my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant fail with thee. Wee reſt upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of a man that never failed us: much more his oath, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 16. An oath is among men a confirmation and end of all ſtrife. Oh! be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware then of ſtrugling againſt God's promiſe, becauſ it carrie's the force of an oath with it. Let mee exemplifie it by a text, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1. 22. The Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> and <hi>Bathſheba</hi> go to <hi>David</hi> and preſs him; Did not my Lord the King ſay, <hi>Salomon</hi> ſhall ſurely reign after mee? How is it then, that <hi>Adonijah</hi> reign's? What did <hi>David?</hi> Hee, rowſing his weak bodie up, ſwear's, As the Lord liveth, who hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered my ſoul out of all adverſitie, as I have ſaid, ſo I will perform it this day: <hi>Salomon</hi> my Son ſhall reign. Was not <hi>David</hi> as good as his word, and durſt any hinder or croſs it? No, it ended the ſtrife, and ſcared away all the Traitors. Oh beware then that thou croſs
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:170649:104"/>
not the Lord in his promiſe, to make him a lier! And I may ſay the like of all other attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God: for the promiſe is that by which God ſeek's himſelf and his own glory infinitely: and therefore hee hath put himſelf wholly unto it.</p>
                  <p>In applying of theſe grounds unto the ſoul faith ſhould do theſe things:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> ſhee ought to ponder well, and muſe upon the promiſe. <hi>Secondly,</hi> bee throughly convinced thereby in her heart, of all theſe grounds. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> ſhee ſhould cleav cloſe to the promiſe againſt all objections. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> ſhee ſhould humbly and wholly obey and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the promiſe. And <hi>laſtly,</hi> ſhee ought to plead the promiſe, and improov it to her own peace.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Pondering a promiſe. Pondering</hi> is, when a man lift's any thing, to eſteem what weight it bear's: ſo ought faith to do with the promiſe: and that in theſe three kindes: 1. <hi>To mark it:</hi> ſet a Star upon the Margin of a ſpecial promiſe: Buy that book which call's out promiſes of note in this kinde. 2. <hi>To muſe upon it:</hi> chew upon the cud: dwell upon it: therefore it is ſaid of <hi>Marie</hi> that ſhee pondered the Angels words in her heart. 3. <hi>To familiarize with it:</hi> get it by heart till it bee eaſie: make it thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom-friend.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:170649:104"/>
So did <hi>David</hi> make promiſe his Counſellor, and companion.</p>
                  <p>II. The ſecond work of the ſoul, is <hi>to bee convinced</hi> of whatſoever hath been ſaid of the wiſdom, ſtrength and truth of God in offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and promiſing pardon to a ſinner. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 9. The Goſpel ſhall <hi>convince</hi> the heart of righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>III. The third work of application is, <hi>cleaving of the ſoul to the promiſe</hi> againſt all her fears, doubts, cavils; for when it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of clear truth, the ſcales of darkneſs fall from her eyes. The ſoul is ſet between vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and mercie; if mercie prevail, then lying vanities ceaſ Hence it is that a convinced heart com's forth and faith, I renounce my ſlaviſh fear, I abhor my baſe mixtures of ſelf and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, vertues and preparatives of mine own. I abandon all my former props of nature, art, experience, religion, which kept mee from mercie: and I cut all knots in ſunder which I cannot unlooſ, and let all my tackling fall into the ſea, and commit my ſoul to thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, through rocks, waves and ſhelvs, that if I periſh, I may periſh, onely I will for ever cling to thy promiſe, do with mee as thou wilt. If I bee deceived, thou haſt deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mee. Thus the ſoul beeing convinced,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:170649:105"/>
claſp's to God, and affiance's it ſelf to him, as the Ivie to the Oak, ſo that break the one and break the other.</p>
                  <p>IV. This affiance cauſeth that ſweet <hi>conſent</hi> and naked <hi>obedience</hi> to the promiſe, according to the Word, and the extent thereof. <hi>Eſay</hi> 1. 19. If yee conſent and obey, yee ſhall eat of the good things, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>V. The laſt work of application differ's not from the former, ſave in degree, and it is the <hi>pleading of a promiſe,</hi> when there is a ſtrong unlikelihood preſented to the ſoul: either from the Lord's leaving it to herſelf, or in temptation, or in deep ſenſ of unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, fear, &amp;c. then ſhee labor's to cling to the promiſe by pleading it ſecretly, as wee ſee in that rare example of the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> who was content to bee put off by ſilence, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, yea taunts: and although ſhee was called a dog, yet ſhee held cloſe to the Word, that <hi>Chriſt was the Son of David:</hi> a true dog, and happie in this that ſhee would not bee beaten off. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Savior ſaith ſhee was of great faith.</p>

Confutation of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who ſay, to cleav to a pomiſe by faith, with cleav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it for ſalvation, is a doctrine of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. But wee anſwer; that as their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Juſtification is the true doctrine of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:170649:105"/>
preſumption of their own works, ſo their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Faith is a meer idol and fancie.</p>

Therefore, inſtead of complaints, do as <hi>Eſter</hi> did, ſhee complained of her weakneſs, but reſted not in that, but went to the King ſaying, <hi>If I periſh, I periſh;</hi> and ſo found the golden ſcepter held out to her.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Sloath and eaſ:</hi> dallying is dangerous. It is the Divel's may-game to ſee men ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack't in the haven. Our nature is to ſeek grace moſt, when it is moſt out of ſeaſon: But that is God's ſeaſon to denie.</p>

Thou alleadgeſt, there is nothing at all wrought in thee towards believing: But why then dareſt thou not turn thy back upon God, and return to follie? Becauſ thou haſt not what thou wouldſt, all is nothing unto thee: But from what (ſave from free mercie) is this, that (I ſay not) thou ſtill mai'ſt hear the word, (which is a favor for an Angel) but that thou breatheſt in the aire, or treadeſt upon the earth?

But my heart hath been hardned againſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie it ſelf, and dallied with it!

Do not think this ſtill ſtream is ſafe: it's the moſt deep and deadly gulf. It oppoſe's the wiſdom, the counſel of God, the depth of his riches of love, the ſecond love of mercie (above the firſt creätion) the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God's diſpenſation, appointing this as the beſt way for redemption, the direct way for the magnifyiug of his bottomleſs grace, who could finde in his heart to love enmitie it felf, and hate holineſs (in a ſort) that hee might love ſinful enemies: it reſiſt's the omnipotent power of God in creäting man: The ſecond time of worſ then nothing it diſannul's his attributes: his offer, truth and faithfulneſs: make's God a lier: chuſe's a worſ choice then <hi>Eve</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> did; hell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heaven: and therefore deſerv's to die that death which it hath choſen: Oh! therefore, judg of this ſin by the ſpiritualneſs of it: and prevent a treble hell by humble accepting and believing promiſe.</p>

                     <head>III. <hi>As a Prophet two waies:</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p n="1">1. By <hi>a declareing work,</hi> which is a witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the ſoul that hee is the true Lord and commander of his people, <hi>Eſay</hi> 55. 4. that hee rule's by his Law, as by his Scepter, that all his Prieſthood and merit end's in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and obedience, that it is his honor that all knees bow to him, and that they kiſs the Son; that hee is object of it through whom the Father is honored: that true libertie ſtand's not in haveing our will, but in putting on this yoke; and who ſo doth otherwiſe, deceiv's himſelf,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By his <hi>revealing work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> by this hee direct's the ſoul, and ſet's the ſteps of it in peace: by this hee uſe's his Law to bee a lively finger to point our dutie for everie occaſion, and to frame the ſoul to draw his Law to every need and uſe in the life: according to that, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 20. Yee have an unction from the Holy One, who telleth you all things. <hi>Eſay</hi> 30. 31. Their ears ſhall hear a voice behinde them, ſaying; <hi>This is the way, walk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in it.</hi> This is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing with direction; by which the ſoul ſee's the uſe of Chriſt in every commandement, and is led on by him as her Guide thereby, as if an Oracle ſhould ſpeak from Heaven; <hi>Eſa.</hi> 55. A leader and commander to his people, <hi>ver.</hi> 4.</p>

                        <hi>Directions</hi> themſelvs concern either God himſelf in the firſt Table; as his inward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of fear, confidence, and ſetting him up to bee our God alone in the <hi>firſt:</hi> Or, our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward reaſonable ſervice, and worſhip of him in pure manner in the <hi>ſecond:</hi> Or, our faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full abearing of our ſelvs in all holineſs, in ſuch actions of common life as are not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate worſhip, in the <hi>third:</hi> (for I refer oathes and vows to the ſecond, which I deſire the wiſe Reader to think of) or the ſet day of our worſhip, upon one day of ſeven (ſince the eighth day was turned into God's day, or the Chriſtian Sabbath) and that in the <hi>fourth.</hi> Or elſ our neighbor and our ſelvs in the other Six; Subjection to all Superioritie in the <hi>fifth:</hi> Maintaining his precious life (as being better then all that follow) in the <hi>ſixth:</hi> Of his Chaſtitie in the <hi>ſeventh:</hi> His Eſtate in the <hi>eighth:</hi> His Name in the <hi>ninth:</hi> The <hi>tenth,</hi> forbidding not onely that concupiſcence which reache's to the detriment of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, but under that, (as moſt ſenſible to us) all that wicked propenſion and bent of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (before actual ſin) whereby originally wee are prone to all injuſtice, and impietie, and intemperance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="247" facs="tcp:170649:126"/>Rules of direction for the clear under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the LAW.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That all the Laws of Chriſt muſt bee underſtood to bee of another manner of force and autoritie than the Laws of men, even the greateſt: for they are limited with exception in all kindes, and do but reach to the outward man, and penalties thereof. But theſe do reach to the conſcience, and they binde the inner man.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Let us know that his commands are not idle things and arbitrarie, which wee may obey at our courteſie; or if not, yet God is as a weak King for whom his ſubjects are too ſtrong, as <hi>Joab</hi> and <hi>Abiſhai</hi> for <hi>David;</hi> but real Laws from an autoritie that both know's offenders, and can puniſh them; yea, which accurſeth all tranſgreſſors, and will not hold them guiltleſs.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Obſerv, that the commands of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table, are the Edicts of the ſame God whoſe the Firſt are, <hi>Jam.</hi> 12. 11. and therefore in which the Lord take's himſelf as truly either honored or not, as the firſt.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Law muſt bee alwaies underſtood according to the ſcope, even as every other part of the Word, as promiſes and threats. Wee muſt not reſt in the bare letter, and ſo
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:170649:127"/>
deſtroy the life and ſpirit of the Law. Look what God aim's at under the groſſeſt, let us alſo aim at, and both abhor each appearance of evil as well as the moſt odious, and cleav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to good in the leaſt as well as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Wee muſt conceiv the Commandements as importing no patch't or pieced obedience to one or a few charges, but an entire and whole one: as the coagmentation of the Laws of both Tables doth import. Let us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way conceiv the ſcope of the Law to require integritie; and all partiall ſervice to bee a forfeit to the whole Law.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Laws of the former Table are generally to bee preferred to the duties of the Second: yet with an exception, that wee conceiv the rule upon equal tearms: thus, That the commands of the firſt rank in the former Table have precedencie over the ſecond, not each branch of the former above the ſecond in their firſt rank. It is generally more excellent that God have his due then man: but not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, for the neglect or contempt of a Sermon are not fouler ſins then the murther of a man.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Underſtand the Commandements to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire at our hands the utmoſt of our wit,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:170649:127"/>
device and courage to ſerv God.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Let us obſerv, the Commandements of God never croſs each other: if any ſuch caſe occur, as wherein one cannot ſtand with the the other, let us know the one muſt alway yeeld to the other.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Let us note this, that duties of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and mercie, which cannot bee otherwiſe don, are to bee preferred to duties of pietie, at that ſeaſon; as the Phyſician doth attend the Patient, wee help the Ox out of the ditch, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then worſhip God firſt, and ſuffer theſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair the whileſt: obedience in ſuch caſes is better then ſacrifice: and the omiſſion of a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is no contempt with God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> I. This Doctine teacheth us to abhor the audaciouſneſs of Popiſh and Heretical and Sciſmatical ones, as, forgetting this ſcope of God in eſtabliſhing one eternal, immutable and pure Rule of righteouſneſs, dare take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to controll this Law of God, and to diminiſh it, cutting off the Second and Tenth Commandements: ſo that if they may prevail, not the Moral Law, but their Commands muſt bee our rules. It is no wonder if theevs might have their will, they would ſuffer no watches to bee kept: or, that deformed women lothe or break al true Glaſſes. Let us ſo much the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:170649:128"/>
rather abhor them, as odious enemies to God, and under pretence of the Law of Libertie walk as lawleſs libertines, and overthrow the Law of Converſation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> II. Let us conſider how dangerous a thing it is to worſhip God according to our own fancies and inventions: It was a good ſpeech of old, They are the beſt Laws which give leaſt power to the Judg. God will have no Judg to bee his Chancellor, to make or interpret, or change Laws; hee know's our boldneſs and ſacriledg in this kinde.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> III. If the Law bee the director of our Converſation: Let it bee uſe of exhortation to all God's people to embrace it, and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to this Scepter of Chriſt, to eſtabliſh his Law in our ſouls, and to lift up him in the honor of our hearts, who hath honored us w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> his royal Law to bee our direction. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> of one <hi>Crow</hi> a Seaman, that beeing in Shipwrack, and haveing caſt all his tacklings and wares, and five pounds of money into the Sea, hee kept his New Teſtament a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his neck, ſo ſwimming upon his broken Maſt, and after four daies (all his company being drowned) yet hee was at length by paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers diſcovered and taken up, all frozen, numb'd and ſterv'd; but yet his Book hee held
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:170649:128"/>
cloſe to him. If wee in the ſhipwracks of this World, would keep our ſouls from wrack, what courſ ſhould wee take? Surely keep this Law to us cloſe, and not ſuffer it to depart from us: loſe money, wares, ſhip and all, ere wee forego that, leaſt wee loſe our conſcience, and diſorder our converſation. And in all our doubtful caſes, whether vows, oaths, marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, dealings with men, entercourſ with God, or any difficultie, go to the Law and teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie (<hi>Eſay</hi> 8. 20.) for a reſolution.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> VI. Let all that finde themſelvs to com ſhort of this platform, I ſay, let them live the life of faith in duties: They that know a Command ſhall fear it. Fear not him who when hee hath kill'd the bodie can go no ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: But him fear, whoſe will is righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and whoſe power is revenge: yea, who can caſt both bodie and ſoul into hell: God's people are taught Obedience from their youth up, both to do and ſuffer, without cavils, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions, or exceptions. The firſt leſſon they learned in the ſchool of Chriſt, was ſelf-deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and naked obeying the Promiſe. That o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to Chriſt hath taught them obedience to God the Father: Chriſt hath made their yoke eaſie, and burden light: ſo that now they
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:170649:129"/>
delight in the Law, being made Chriſt's Law.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> V. This convince's all hypocrites obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law. Alas! It's no direction for their lives, they look at the Law ſtill as a whip and bondage. They dare not ſuffer themſelvs to bee informed of the Law: When they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſiſt it, yet they are not convinced in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: they think it bootleſs to obey, <hi>Eſa. 58. Mal.</hi> 3. They wiſh the Law were according to their own ſcantling, or elſ were not at all. Hence all their life is nothing but a ſtudy to interpret the Laws of God with favor to their own corruption.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> VI. Let this teach us to live by faith, for abilitie in Chriſt to all performances: truſt wee God upon a promiſe for each part of his courſ, to God, men, our ſelvs; in ſolitarineſs, company, calling, in Sabbaths, ſubjection to ſuperiors, and common life. Say thus, Lord, theſe duties are above mee, I can do nothing to purpoſe: enable mee to do what thou bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, and bid what thou wilt; elſ the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and weight of them will tire and clog mee. Thou haſt eaſed me O Lord of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but ſtill (even in my libertie from Chriſt) I carrie old <hi>Adam</hi>'s burden about mee. Therefore write theſe laws in my heart
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:170649:129"/>
I beſeech thee, that I may delight in the Law in my inner man, and that I may run thy commandements with cheerfulneſs.</p>

                     <p>Truth, if it bee once loſt in the judgment, will not long hold in the practice: therefore wee muſt bee well principled and grounded in the Truth, love it for it ſelf, and embrace it with our beſt affections: Not beeing wheeled and hurried about with the new tricks and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of men of unſound judgment: nor yet put on ſom truthes for a time, with great zeal and heat, and ſuddenly when a greater heat of oppoſition ariſe's, out of a giddie minde and fearful heart, recant as faſt and betray the truth of God to time-ſervers and Enemies.

A ſolemn courſ uſed by all the Saints both in ordinarie, and by occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Joſhua</hi> (cap. <hi>ult.</hi>) tell's <hi>Iſrael,</hi> That hee and his houſ would ſerv the Lord. <hi>David</hi> did not onely reſolv <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 57. and vow, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. to keep the Word of God, but alſo ſware to keep his righteous judgments.

                     <p>II. <hi>Watchfulneſs</hi> is not onely given the Saints to awake out of their dead ſleep: but when the Lord hath given them light and grace (in ſtead thereof) and purged them from

Concerning the former, the Chriſtian ſoul muſt keep the watch of God, <hi>Num.</hi> 9. 18.

                     <p>This experience teacheth the people of God to bee every one an <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> to another, a Preacher, telling others what they have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the courſ of things, teach them what is vanitie and froth and what is ſubſtance.

In reſpect of our inward actual luſts and paſſions; which as Saint <hi>James</hi> ſaith, fight in our members, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. but as <hi>Peter</hi> addeth, fight againſt our ſouls. Theſe luſts do ſnib and kill the growth of goodneſs in the ſoul, and over-drip the grace of God as a ſowre ſhadow and the bows of a Walnut-tree do keep under ſom tender Plant: or as the blaſting of the Eaſt-winde the bloſſoms.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the actual breakings out in open of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences and exceſſes: as oathes, blaſphemies, impietie to God, and open contempt of his Word, Sabbath, patience, croſſes, bleſſings:
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:170649:140"/>
open cooſenage, uncleanneſs, intemperance, idleneſs, wrath, rage, unmercifulneſs, revenge, worldlineſs, and the like.

How unſavorie doth a luſt make our hearts? how dead, defiled? how doth the heart wax polluted thereby as a ſink-hole? how is it firſt deceived, then defiled, then habited to ill Cuſtom, then growing to a nature, riveted and confirmed? then how ſullen, dead and dark do wee grow by it, how endleſs an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite of adding drunkenneſs to thirſt doth it procure?

                  <p>II. <hi>Lett</hi> of a Believer is <hi>Satan:</hi> who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee could not do us hurt but by our ſin, yet by that tunnell let's in a woful deal of his own into us, worſ then our own, enflame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and exaſperateing ſin in us by the adding of his own malice to our ſin, as more waters make the flood greater.</p>
                  <list>
                     <head>Two things here to bee noted:</head>
                     <item>1. The <hi>properties</hi> of the <hi>Tempter.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. The <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the <hi>Temptation.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The <hi>Properties</hi> are theſe; <hi>Firſt</hi> Malice ever ſet's him on work againſt the bodie and ſoul of the Creature. <hi>Secondly</hi> Vigilancie and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alway do aſſiſt his Temptations. <hi>Thirdly</hi> Miſchief and wo is ever in the end thereof, to pull the ſoul from Union and Communion with God. <hi>Fourthly</hi> the Method and manner of his tempting, which is to bee weighed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the parties tempted. If weak and unable to reſiſt, hee tread's down the low hedg, never troubling himſelf further need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly. And thus hee is himſelf, a Lyon. <hi>Firſt</hi> to anticipate the counſel of the heart in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting ſin by the ſuddenneſs of injection. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> to aſſault judgment and conſcience both at once, in blindeing the one, and in bindeing the other: Thus hee blinded <hi>Eve</hi> in that ſpeech, <hi>God knoweth that your eies ſhall bee open, and yee made as Gods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> By his bindeing the will in point of her reſiſtance; and that by the exceſſiue
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:170649:141"/>
ſweet of the bait. Thus to <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Bathſheba. Thirdly,</hi> by putting on the perſon of one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpected; as ſomtimes purſuers of a man will praiſ him to get others to betray him: And <hi>Jäel</hi> to deceiv <hi>Siſera</hi> brought him Cream in a Lordlie diſh. And thus hee becom's an Angel of light, as holy as a Preacher. Thus hee tempt's Chriſt to leap down, and to make ſtones bread, out of a godly end (forſooth) that God's power might bee gloriſied in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle. Avoid Devil, God need's not my ſin to honor himſelf; I ſin too much unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, I need not add ſin to ſin willingly!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By the deluſions and the deceits which hee beguile's ſilly ſouls by, that hee may circumvent them and bring them into his ſnare. Hee hath fine names to ſet upon odious crimes: that with the names, the things might enter eaſily. Adulterie or fornication are but tricks of youth: prodigalitie, but good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip: faſhions, but handſomneſs: mizer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, but providence: pride of heart and life, but good courage, and liveing in good ſort: Theſe are his dice-play and cunning, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. The Harlot entiſe's the young man by her ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Carpets, and perfumes; her Husband's ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: Theſe delude the heart and blear the eie, till like a fool his heart bee darted through.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>Touching his <hi>preventing</hi> thus:</p>
                  <p>No ſooner doth hee ſee any ſinner make to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the voice of GOD, to look into his old courſ, or hearken after a new; but preſently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee ſet's upon them even in their entrance. <hi>Firſt,</hi> By preſenting old ſins, with all their circumſtances, order of them, number, hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſs, continuance, long contempt, &amp;c. to diſmay them from poſſibilitie of converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Or, hee aſſault's them with their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of capacitie, or memorie, gifts, or parts, that they ſhall never compaſs ſuch great things. Or hee diſcourage's them with their husband's ill will, the loſs of father's love, and land: Or that the things they muſt forego both in liberties and laws, are more then they can bear. But, O Satan, avant! The Lord hath prevented mee, and drawn mee out of
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:170649:142"/>
darkneſs: ſhall hee ſuffer mee to periſh in light?</p>
                  <p>Touching his <hi>aſſiſting</hi> thus:</p>
                  <p>Eſpecially in the firſt works of the Law, hee corrupt's the minde and ſpirit, both in the enlightning part, and the terrifying. The former hee abuſeth to multiplie the fearful view of ſin: The later, to make terror intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable.</p>
                  <p>Touching his <hi>perfecting</hi> thus:</p>
                  <p>Here hee labors's to hold them under, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by the irkſom bondage. Oh, ſaith hee, faith only is of the Elect, and thou art none: it's the free gift of God, and hee may denie it as well as grant it. Somtimes hec make's it leſs then it is, to puff up up the heart with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption: Or hee hide's the virtuous ſavor and ſtrength of the Promiſe, the ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the faithfulneſs of the Promiſer, and the offer.</p>

An hypocrite ſeparate's the means from the end; looking for peace where there is no uprightneſs. But here the ſtratagem of the Devil is contrarie; and therefore, either hee hide's that from his eie, which ſhould bee his main comfort in all failings: or elſ take's van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by that which ſhould bee his humiliation, to bee his utter diſcouragement. And although hee cannot rob it of the truth of grace, yet hee rob's it of the comfort thereof, chuſeing to
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:170649:143"/>
play at any game, rather then ſit out.</p>

                     <head>2. <hi>Against</hi> it thus:</head>
                     <p>Sundrie waies hee labor's to bring the ſoul under ſin, to renounce a good courſ, to bee ſlack, remiſs, looſ, common, prophane, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, even by conſent. And this is his moſt natural temptation. For, as hee is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly wicked; ſo, it's little to him that comfort bee ſtopped, except the conſcience bee waſted. Oh what a May-game was it (think wee) to ſee <hi>David</hi> foiled by Adulterie, <hi>Noah</hi> by Drunkenneſs, <hi>Lot</hi> by Inceſt, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> by Pride, <hi>Peter</hi> by Revolt? <hi>Firſt,</hi> Hee mark's his ſeaſon and time, when the heart is moſt naked, unarmed, at eaſ, (as <hi>Abſalom</hi> and <hi>Amnon</hi>) ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt open, and being ſwept and garniſh't; which perhaps, another time would have been armed, jealous, and fearful. Hee concur's not onely with the corruption of the heart, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: but, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> with the conſtiution and complexion of the ſpirit of nature in a man: Is hee propenſ to luſt, to uncleanneſs, to jovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alneſs, to ambition? Oh, (ſaith hee) hee is mine! I will tempt him with meet baits. <hi>Thirdly.</hi> Hee watche's the accommodation of occaſions; as when exceſs of chearfulneſs, or of ſadneſs, of praiſes or diſgraces, of wel-fare and ſucceſs, or defeat, or the like; and when the ſpirits
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:170649:144"/>
are open, then is his opportunitie to work the heart to wanton ſpeech, to riot, to wrath and diſcontent, to ſwelling pride, to oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of gifts, to the makeing away of a man's ſelf, and the like. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Hee will make uſe of their beſt Graces and Priviledges: all men know you well enough to bee one that make conſcience, you may do ſuch or ſuch a thing, and no man ſuſpect you; therefore bee not ſo nice in trifles, defeat an Orphan, oppreſs the fatherleſs, falſifie the truſt repoſed in you, &amp;c. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Somtime of ſecrecie of time and place: who ſhall ever finde it out? <hi>Sixthly,</hi> by fine co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors of pretenſed meaning. So, by color of juſtice, my pains have been ſuch and ſuch in buſineſs for others, why may not I pay my ſelf ſo and ſo, they beeing never the wiſer; and perhaps, never the worſ, as the caſe may ſtand? <hi>Seventhly,</hi> By their falls, to drive them to ſin for ſomwhat, rather then to bee puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a little, over-ſhooes, over-knees: So, by comparing themſelvs with worſ then themſelvs, to bee bold and preſumptuous in libertie-takeing: By the oft ſhunning of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful occaſions, to venture beyond their Calling, and ſo bee ſnared. Nay by truthes of God, both in examples of the Saints falls, why maieſt not thou do ſo and repent? and in
